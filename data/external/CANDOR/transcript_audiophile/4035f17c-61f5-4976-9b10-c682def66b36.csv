Aren't they such little pills at that age, Kenny said, watching Corrie go, they are peculiar. Patricia said They're pills. She said that her little pills go out to be tied up in a second, let out when they're 18. Set up in a second, let out wondering Oh, I know, mm mhm. I'm trying teen who ought to be tied up in a second letter when they're 18 here, I brought you this. She handed Patricia across a new paperback copy of Evidence of love. I know you think it's trash kitty said, but it has passion, love, hate, romance, violence, excitement. It's just like thomas hardy only in paperback and eight pages of photos in the middle. I don't know. Patricia said, I don't have a lot of time, like Kitty was already retreating to her car. Patricia decided that this mystery should be called Patricia Campbell and the inability to say no. To her surprise, she tore through the book in three days. Patricia almost didn't make the meeting right before she left. Corey washed her face and living tubes to get rid of her freckles and wound up getting it in both eyes, sending her shrinking into the hall, where she ran face first into a door knob. Patricia blessed her eyes with water, put a bag of frozen peas on her crusade, told cory she had just as many, if not more freckles when she was her age and got her settled on the sofa with MS mary to watch the Cosby show. She made it to the meeting. 10 minutes late, Kitty lived on seaweed farms, a 200 acre chunk of Boone hall plantation that had been parceled off a long time ago as a wedding present to some lord proprietor or other through misadventure and poor decision making. It had come to Kitty's grandmother in law, and when that eminent old lady had declined elegantly into her grave, she passed it on to her favorite grandson, Kitty's husband force way out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by flooded rice fields, entangled pine forest dotted with broken back out buildings inhabited solely by snakes. It was anchored by a hideously ugly main house, painted chocolate brown and wrapped in sagging porches and rotting columns, with raccoons in the attic and a possums in the walls. It was exactly the kind of grand home suspended in a state of gracious decay. Patricia thought all the best charlestonians own now. She stood before the massive double doors on the sprawling front porch and press the bell, and nothing happened. She tried again. Patricia, kitty called Patricia, looked around, then up kitty leaned out the second floor window, go around to the side, kitty hollered. We haven't been able to find the key to that door and forever she met giddy by her kitchen door. Big kitty said don't mind the cat Patricia didn't it? Sure. Mhm.",,226.94,1,False,False,535
