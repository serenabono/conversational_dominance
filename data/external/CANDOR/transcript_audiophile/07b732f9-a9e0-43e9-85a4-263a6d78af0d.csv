The newest member, it's never too early to start branding covers my book. So that's yeah, he's gonna be a good little door knocker, I can tell you. You know, I don't know we're speaking of actually, so I have a little surprise for you to twins. No, I wish actually, no, you know, I kind of do not if they're like you. So I actually got a cake for all of you guys and it's going to be a six center of gender sex. I don't get it. How does it gonna say it's going to be pink or blue? Oh, blue, Yes, come on. Hope for everything is good and healthy. I'm looking forward to meet him. I'm happy. I'm very, very excited. I'm really actually so unfortunate day and never touch you either. What's going on? But not much just excited for Maya and her, you know, we'll see how that works out. Uh So, you know, some of the girls were saying they felt like kind of a little bit of tension in the office between us. I don't know, do you feel like they're essential? I'm not gonna lie. Yes, I do feel like there's a little tension. Yeah. Um My assumption is that you just don't like me. I don't know, that's not true. I mean, I don't know you, so how could I just not like you? But I feel like the same time of what? S he makes me a little like assistant, just trust you because when you first joined us and married him in the office and she had the whole, you know that dinner with remain where they talked about their future and stuff, she's crying, you know, you were so um thanks to her. I think that was really sweet then you kind of question the relationship and I were talking, I felt like you were them, you know, hey, that's where everything is coming from because I think that's so weird that you say that we were having a conversation of private conversation that was asking me questions and then you turned it around to marry and made it sound like I was talking bad about her and just now you said that I was and I wasn't, I was asking questions in a private situation because I didn't know. So I was thinking it was a cool, a lot to like asking private, but I also feel like the way you asked was not necessarily control. It was kind of like you had an opinion about I think you were saying she should get it for you. I think everybody should. I don't know that. And you don't know me either. So it's kind of like, you know, lost in translation maybe. I don't know. But it seemed like it wasn't a neutral opinion. It seemed like it was an opinion, right? I don't like to face people and I'm not saying you are two faced, but it's going that direction. And I was like, wow, you were super nice to her. But then you didn't actually tell like you were very supportive here. So I was like, wow. Like at least I'm like direct, you know, like, wow, that was a lot. Okay. Yeah. At least I'm honest. You know, I'd rather that than have to guess like where you step. Okay. So you think then on toothpaste, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. I said, I'm not saying you are, but it's going that direction. Okay, Well I will leave it at that. I don't feel like anything. I have to say past this point. You're going to change your opinion. It's clear that this is going the wrong way. All right. Well, I'm sorry, dad. Go that way. And what can we do? You know, what can we do? Okay. It's almost impossible to be friends with Davina at this point. My hands are I just give up and I see who she is and I'm just gonna do what I can to work with her in a cordial way. But I now know that there's no mistake and we're not what's going on? I always had a little conversation about the vibe in a weird vibe between, you know, a little bit person is my first by you heather. Yes, Yes. Are you leaving? Yeah, you are unnecessarily tonight. Well, I'm not going to go outside for one second. Okay. I know, so dramatic. I just feel like you know, so we're back in the office shall stay. I mean kind of you know. Yeah. I told you I basically said she's going down the path of the two face. Yeah. And it makes my trust her. It's like you say things and then you don't know it up to them. Like the dinner that we had when I asked myself what she said, she wouldn't own up to it and I'm like really? You were that locked out? You don't so I'm not the only person, you know. Come on.
