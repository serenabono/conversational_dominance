Many of you guys already know that I was came out to human trafficking. A big truck driver. I was able to escape. I was looking through your comments and I've seen a lot of people saying that they believe that he's a legit Adrian, so not a real person, but a drawer. And I'm going to share with you guys why I believe that too. Before I ran through the corn fields by myself, you gave me water, sweat and a cardigan. Just that told me his name about three times and I kept on forgetting his name. That's forward. I get to my ass house. I rush I packed all my bad. I wanted to remember this guy so I took the cardigan and I put it inside the look different than everybody. When I got to tell you, I packed my bags and try to get people not, they're nowhere to be found until this thing. I don't remember his face. Everything I'm about to share with you. Yes, that's very strained. Uh huh. But yeah, yeah, if you had $86,400 in your bank account and someone stole $10 from you which you throw the other $86,390 away. Of course not. So you have 86,400 sex. Everyone, everyone is here, hook, everybody's here. Okay now we're going to get more people in here. Actually, can you come and tell her that you're here for her? Okay. Okay. You've got a bunny. Everyone is here. Wait, okay, wow. I know. Way down the hair. It's never finally get the hair dryer like oh well a little bit, but that's not the one we're going for a nice and easy. Okay, beautiful. Got a bear here before things got a tub on its head when he's getting scared. Oh, 24 hour, we're gonna get this tub off his head. Next look, a just a baby bear here every day, shuttle around the circle around, just get out of your, yep. Uh huh. You saved our little beer swim. Happy from Yeah, the bear here before things got a tub on its head. Well, he's getting scared. Oh, 24 hour already, get this tub off his head. Next look, the way I work hard, every argument with, it's called the Socratic method. It comes from H increase and of course it's basically you play down and ask a lot of clarifying questions and by doing so you force people to find out. For example, let's say, someone says you gotta get a mexican to do your one, you could say that raises a shit or you can say, what do you mean by that? You just put the spotlight on what they were really trying to say. Which of course systems and not only that it was wrong, but also learned from another example, you're pretty for black, you could snap your well in your right to do so or you could say wait these kinds of questions what they're really trying to say by the way, you're probably already using it. Like if someone says, oh I love you, say, what do you mean by that way, choose your scenarios, why? Because this yourself opportunity ended up making a lot of enemies. And what way I don't know what they don't know. The thing is this is the whole reason I even started making videos like this thought from watching animal, but I knew I needed to know about most, but then I saw the next to a card, my entire understanding and you know it's crazier. My God, what is that? Yeah. Oh my God, what is that? Hey girl you sound a lot more confident when you remove the word just from your vocabulary, Try this instead. Okay, so and so I'm following up on X. Y. Z. To get a status update. I wanted to check out X. Y. Z. Because anything I can do to assist, please let me know, let me know your thoughts. Looking forward to hearing from you. Hey girl you Oh mm hmm. Uh huh Right. Uh looking at my new furniture. Um but I just found out my dad's pregnant, so I'm kind of like on a tighter budget, what is the price on this when there's 4 49 sniffed my sec. That's a lot. Um how weiner stiff are you on that price? It's not negotiable. Okay, you guys, except like it from Canada. It. Let me just say this though, Canadian. Uh this is why I stay out of Africa. There's a man by the name of Morris plots and you felt God tell him that he needed to go to Africa and go help remote african tribes come to jesus. So Morris went to Africa but he didn't have a car to drive around to these different tribes. When all of a sudden the spirit of the Lord told him that there would be a vehicle waiting for him on the side of the road. The next day he ended up finding a red cheap and him and his interpreter went to go find this tribe out in the eastern Africa. Now this was dangerous because this tribe was very well known for killing white men. And as Morrison his interpreter roll up to the tribe, they see hundreds of african warriors come after them with their spirits picking. They're about to die. They freak out. Certainly the whole tribe takes in the interpreter, asked the chief, what's going on? Chief looked at the interpreter and said. A man in a white cloud came here yesterday and spoke to us. He was an all white garments that he told us that a man in a red chariot would be coming to show us the path to eternal life, jesus is king. If it how to survive a conversation with your girlfriend or wife step one is going to be the most difficult. You are going to have to act somewhat interested in what she's talking about. This can be done by raising your eyebrows and not infrequently step to your on cruise control man. You can zone out. You can think about what you're going to be later.",,746.88,7,False,False,1114
