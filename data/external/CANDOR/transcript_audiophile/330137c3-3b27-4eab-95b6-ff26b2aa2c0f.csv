So it might be tricky to do that, but but like all different aspects about how you can prepare your kid and not just um career prep because some of it is soft skills, but it's just teaching the parents, you know, these are things that you can be doing to get them set. Maybe even starting some kind of a mentor group because or a network group because of some parents don't have big networks so maybe we need to create one. Um so that parents can, you know share their know how or whatever. So I'm just like coming up with ideas now and I think it will be a neat idea.
