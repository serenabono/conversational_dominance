Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mhm. Okay. Mhm. She didn't state republican convention. I'm going to try to this in one take because if we were doing this live, I wouldn't have the option of doing any edits or transitions or anything like that. A little bit about my background for 20 years of law enforcement experience. I started out as a patrol officer. I personally dealt with many of the issues that continue to plague our communities, such as mental illness and drug addiction. I rose through the ranks to sergeant and later lieutenant uh and my experience leading and managing people in large government agency will serve me well. Leading the attorneys, investigators and support staff of the attorney general's office. I went to law school and pass the bar while working full time as a police officer. So I'm not afraid of long hours and putting in hard work. I have a combined seven years experience conducting internal investigations for the city of Seattle Police Department and also for Seattle public schools. I would say that government accountability is a passionate, violent, actually accountability across the board. It applies equally to everybody. I ran a solo law practice in Lake stevens where the majority of my clients I served with either reduced rates or free. Um, so what will I do as attorney general will be guided by our federal and state constitutions. Every action I take will be with the recognition that our government exists to protect the rights of the individual and I will view the people of our state as my ultimate clients. I'm sure there are constitutional laws are applied to everyone equally. I will serve as a check on the governor when needed. And I will certainly serve as a check on the Legislature. If the legislature doesn't have the courage to pass their laws in full view of the people, they should not necessarily expect that I will enforce their laws. I work with everyone I can to make improvements to our courts, including family law. Courts are criminal justice, mental health and social services systems. I will work with our next Republican governor to address crime and disorder in Seattle King County, which has been allowed to fester and has become a regional, if not statewide problem. We'll never compromise when it comes to our constitutional rights, especially the Second Amendment. And I will investigate our state's response to the covid outbreak. Top to bottom, including the actions of jay inslee. We can never allow our state's economy to be shut down and our schools and churches closed over a highly questionable quote unquote emergency. It's a little bit about why I'm running. I'm the first time candidate. I'm not politically connected. The damage that bob Ferguson has and continues to do to our state is too lengthy list during our conquer today shocked that no Republican ran against Ferguson on 2016. We can't win if we're not even on the field. And I decided at that time if nobody else stepped forward in 2020 I would, I watched and waited waiting for an established candidate to test the waters, maybe take some public shots in Ferguson and explore a possible campaign. And I never saw that. So in april 2019 I decided since I had no political experience. I better get started, um, far from a household name, but I have grassroots support across the state. As I've traveled, a statement with people, I notice there's a lot of anger over how our state is run, but there's also a lot of apathy. Recently I met a young man in Yakima was 27 who finally registered to vote. He finally had enough. He'll be voting for the first time in august and he will be voting republican. I have much more experience as a voter than as a candidate. So from that perspective of voter ID like to consider this, I think we are partly to blame the Republican voter apathy. We have repeatedly given inches in the name of reaching across the aisle only to have democrats pick miles when they have near complete control of our government. We can no longer afford to play by the democrats rules and accept their apprentices. We need to get off the ropes, stand up for ourselves and fight for our ideals and our beliefs. That's the kind of candidate I am and that's the kind of attorney general out. B mm. So in closing again, my name is Brett Rogers, right for Washington State Attorney General. I thank you for the time you give me here today. Uh, you learn like to learn more bombing. Please go to Brett Rogers for H G dot com. You can also find me on facebook and twitter. Uh, I'll appreciate your vote and of course I would greatly appreciate your financial support. Thank you again. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mhm. Mhm Yeah, Yeah. Mhm. Okay. Yeah, yeah.
