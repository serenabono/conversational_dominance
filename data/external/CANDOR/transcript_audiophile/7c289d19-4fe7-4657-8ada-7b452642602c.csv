Oh my gosh that's incredible, wow that's so cool that you've done some apology because when I was in high school um my mom actually talked into that curriculum as well. She's actually a lot like you where she's more into like the literature history side of home schooling than the science side And so that's actually part of why she sent me to like a charter school too, do some of my science because she didn't want to do any labs. Like she tried to like when, when I was young, when I was in like elementary school, she tried to work it out, she's like use milk cartons, empty milk cartons to try to like grow plants and like show us plant cycles and stuff. But she just really, it really wasn't her thing. So I ended up going on to that too. But that is simple that your husband was able to do so many labs because I didn't really, I didn't really have an opportunity to do many collapse until I came to college. Um because a lot of times when I did apology, I just did the book on my own. So like I did the physics book in high school, but I didn't I wasn't really interested in the physics lab so much. So I ended up negotiating with my mom and I designed my own uh physics lab to do instead of the labs that they gave in the book because I am, I'm really interested in creative writing as well, and I like writing sci fi. And so at the time I was working on a project where one of the key ideas to it was I was like writing about um the Earth before um like guangguang long ago, like at the point of Pandya right, I was writing like way way back and I had this really novel idea at the time that there might be at that point, two moons circling there, because like, it's so long ago, you know, nobody would tell us about it. Um and so I have this whole idea was like oh like how would they tell time if there were two different things orbiting? Um And so that got me thinking as I was studying physics uh that actually having two moons would change a lot more than just how people told time in a society like that. I realized that like having multiple like an extra celestial body would change the whole frequency of like the tight and the whole like all these things. And so I I got really interested in that and I was like like no no that's really cool. I need to figure out what the beaches would be like in this world. And so I did a lab calculating um by giving it theoretical values and stuff calculating the force that the sun has on the Earth's tides, the force that the moon has on the earth's tides and then the force that a second moon would have on the earth's tides if I added it in and then I made a composite and it was so cool because it was, it was amazing like because at times where um the sun and both the moon's would line up at the same place, I would get tides that were like way bigger than tides that we would see right now, um which would be so cool because you know, that would like extend beach by OEMs significantly if that was happening in that. Um but at the same time, I think pretty much the coolest thing that I saw in these graphs was um I hadn't anticipated it, but there were also points on the draft where because of all the forces because of the extra force that this moon moon added when the new moon was countering the old moon and the sun, it would actually kill the tides more than we see um with the sun and the moon. Because even when the sun and the moon are fighting so to speak over who's controlling the tides, the moon is significantly stronger. But having a second moon totally threw that out of whack and created like basically like Like points at which there was like zero Tide change for like eight hours and and like just total like which is so cool to think about. It was definitely like a really cool application of like um thinking about science fiction and writing characters in the world that I hadn't really thought about. But also like flushing them out using the science that I could understand and the science that I could I don't know pursue. Yeah",0.30999999999994543,282.71000000000004,1,False,False,817
