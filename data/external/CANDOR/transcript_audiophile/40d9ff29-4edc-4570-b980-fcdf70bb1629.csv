0,5aea85ab831584000180a1f6,1.34,527.75,"In Chapter three, but I could find at least. So let's move on baby. Chapter four. Okay guys, we're in Chapter four. Now, we're gonna be searching some more recordings. None of this opening room. It's always over guys for his one which says he can't be saved. Which is obviously a reference to Boris because Boris was just taken by Alice Angel. And yeah, he can't be saved. Because you know what happens at the end of the chapter, Susie's Alice has always transformed Boris into this hideous sort of brute cut. So, you know, it's kind of a Okay guys, we're going into the maintenance area now where these trains are and the flooded room with norman pots, projectionists where he pops up. Once again, You're actually unable to use the looking glass in this room with Boris guys all on the ride for that matter. So there wasn't any more recordings in Chapter four. But I just wanted to let you guys know that this room doesn't hold any secrets as far as I can tell, because we're gonna move to chapter five and look for the last secret messages. Here's a look inside and you will need this. And this just proves again, you know, there's no way he would know who was a wrench there unless he's done this before. So he's left himself a way out. Now, if we look at his drawings here, Henry sketches, he's put a message, you draw beautifully. So he's giving himself a little compliment, which is kind of a bit egotistical, but at the same time, he's just confident in himself, hasn't got much else to live for the moment, has it? There's not really anything else in uh this room. Guys, apart The Big Fish here, which is an easter egg reference to book past two. Used to be a lovely guy chatting on twitter a few times. He's one of the team involved in making the game believe. Creative director, that's the book, pasta fish there, that's a little reference to remember on the team. They go through here, guys and see another message just on the wall, just as follow me, it's just Henry leading himself down the path. So we'll skip ahead to the next message now guys, because as we go through the caverns here and we emerge where Alison and tom are taking a barge away downstream before we get on our barge, we can actually look down on the floor and it'll say there's something in the river Henry's warning himself about a giant bend, the creature that's living beneath the surface of the river. Of course, it may not be bending himself, but I believe it could be a morgue version of bending we've seen at the end of this chapter, Bendy Can a Ball. Right, so it's just arriving inside the village of the Most wonderful or shantytown in the studios. There's actually a couple of messages here guys that we can pick up on the first one is over here on this house, he says you bring death with a skull on the youth. So obviously Henry's sort of saying you know by coming here we're gonna end up fighting all of the Muslims, living huge with just workers of the studio and end up harming them. And he's even written above the knot, wants to sign hurt over the top of that. Once people now fallen into despair and see it's kind of like a little shrines for lost one to all their hands. It's on there and I can leave that. Ski only they're the only ones I can find in this area. The only messages I can find maybe more hidden around here, but that's all I can see personally. So we'll move on to the next section after we fall down. This giant kit, which obviously we know now Henry can survive because he's in a cartoon world, which is why you can keep surviving these massive drops. Look here, we can see another message which says it's inside the box. Henry just leading himself towards his final objective. Okay guys, we got to the office of Joey drew. Now and now once we go into this room, there's actually a secret message within Joey's office which you can see when we look at the wall behind us guys as we come through that door, call it behind us and says who is the man behind the monster? He's asking the question, who is Joey? Really like who is the man behind the monster? Can we finally get to find out with this audio log and find out what it is, Joey but obviously pulled Susie Campbell into you becoming Alice Angel for first experiment of many at the studio, Joey drew truly was a monstrous man has become part of a bolt area here and if we go over to the back war, you'll see another secret message which says the demon has taken it because once we go inside the box below, you'll see that it's actually empty. Looks like whatever it was here was taken long ago. Okay guys, did you remember how earlier I said that if you give forest bone in chapter three, you'll get a secret to do with thomas Collins version of forests in the chapter five. Well this is the secret, see he's actually got a bone in his mouth. Once again, it's kind of like the ghost of the bone I suppose. And I guess this is Henry is contemplating on back to this forest, reminds me a little bit of his. Although the personality is obviously very different. Do you think the over Boris was frank's? To be honest? And this one is thomas Connor of course, you can also see the little halo above Allison's head, this uh glass as well, which kind of shows for Alison? Yes, indeed Alice. If we didn't already know, as you can see here, we've reached the final boss battle and this natural secrets during this boss battle, just basically show you how to get the best routes I believe, to call believers in sequence. As you can see here got arrows which sort of lean off, way around Uh two different our two different leaders around the room. Let's show you the next ones down here, playbacks rounds and avoid bending. Go to the second leave launches here, Henry is obviously this lets himself directions here leading to the relevant places where the leaves about. There's a message here by this door guy which is open this door which is just Henry basically telling himself to call believers. I think it's more just therefore players who can't figure out what to do in that area. Although the first time I plate is, I can actually think too look through the looking glass in this part. But that is the last a lot of messages in Bendy. I mean chapter five and that concludes this video goes that every message will find well at least everyone I know of at least France any in this final room here. As you can see apart from the arrow over there, which is just showing you to go, so that is it for the video. And yeah, go check on my theory about the ending of chapter five. If you want a detailed analysis on everything that happened. And I hope you enjoyed this one. It's been quite a chill now and laid back when I think of course if you have enjoyed today's video guys protecting you know, it's, it's trying to channel use just like this one as well as he'd be a comment down below and let me know what you think the secret messages until next time. I'll say goodbye. Have today and I'll see. Yeah. Okay. So we go, Yes. Okay. Okay. Mhm. Mhm, mm hmm. It's incredible. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Mhm Yeah. Nothing personal. Yeah. Mm. Mhm.
