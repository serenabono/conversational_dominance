Which is pretty interesting. Okay, figure. Mhm. Okay. Shit. Yeah. Hello? Right. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah, Let's go. Yeah. Right. What? Yes. All right. So now we have a pre workout in 1139. Here's the deal. I've been ready to go to the gym for an hour, but I'll get in big trouble if I go before noon because the wife is a late sleeper. She's a night owl. She always has been, She reads, she's read like, I don't know. It feels like 100 books already since the year start. Loves to read and loves to sleep. Issue is my gym since COVID has moved right next to the bedroom and I have a smith machine and you'll see it just a second. It's pretty awesome. But it's noisy. And uh, she wouldn't take too kindly to being waking up before noon. So, uh, we'll do a little stretching first and then we'll head up there and I'll show you what the new setup looks like. Somebody else has officially awakened. So, Eddie, my boy, our son. He came to visit for a week or two before Covid and he's still here. He's showing off. What are you showing off? What, what? He's showing off their, how'd you get that from his parents? He just started golfing and we've been big balls up there, which will show you a little bit later today on the simulator and I finally took him to actually play golf and he fell in love as any better. Yeah, he doesn't hurt back, but we've been playing up on the simulator. He wants to play me even he played me a four day match for $1000.100 bucks a hole. And these two rounds and down 10 shots. I can't handle this. So good. Yeah. You putt for dough. What's that? What do they think you drive for? Show putt for dough? That's how we do it. All right. Obviously, since Covid gyms and all, that is not a thing. But the show must go on. So we upgraded our gym here at the house and I'll show you. I got the F. T. Two trainer suggestion. Yeah, it does. Everything will show you how you got free weights adjustables bar. Currently could be any of us. This variation inside here, we've got j got a good solid vantage of the spider girl right there. God makes compliance. You don't work on. You got the trend now rubber. It's more freeways here and well here you got robert. This is the piece W stops. It is the trainer. Okay. This guy right here doesn't all got eight Cable Pulleys. You've got police down there, police over top part there. You've also got a smith par, but you can use bend your breasts for all full house. It's one of the other unique things that are doing with fritz that was different than what I've been doing in the past. Typically do like the new splits. You know, I'll look back and buy since they, one of the ways in which we didn't do a lot of cardio during this whole program shocking. Think like a cardio hardly any. What we did do is full body workouts. Okay, so for example, today we got on the agenda is what we're doing. We're doing taste like a higher weight, lower Right? So you're like four sets of eight barbell squats using this machine. And we do a done deal remaining Douglas so remaining. Uh huh. I can't speak something else. All right. And then we're gonna do semi super native dumbbell press, it's just like a bench press just a burden that dumbbells. Then we're gonna do a lap by machine. She wanted to pull downs and run into a dumbbell incline club. Then we're going to do uh three super sets of spider girls bicep curls and then a dumbbell overhead tricep extension followed by machine standing calves. Which I can do here with the smith machine. Again, calves right? There might be some planks, some drugs because one of the things it's like lean her neck, it's real skinny so pop that out and then after that is a little Albertine where we've got the rope right here we'll do some side bends and things like that. So uh do some like golf style, you read over. So anyways this is what we're doing for about the next seven minutes. Got the T. V. Typically this podcast. Hockey Central whatever. Speaking of podcasts, don't forget to check out that poker podcast which is our podcast will be recording one Tuesday night um sort of the world series of poker discussing, but the plane is for World Series of poker flocks. This is gonna be different right, playing on my I don't know. Alright, work out in the books now. It's time for the stalls creation I came up with, it gives you a meal plan and he sort of started fiddling with things here and there. I found that a tablespoon of baking powder can do wonders for your post workouts. Instead of drinking a shake, I drink plenty of water. I turn the protein powder, add a little water, 11 teaspoon of baking powder, poppy is coming. Hey boys, they are the people yet I got boys one tablespoon of baking powder, all the things, hold it a little bit of water and put some apples on it, cinnamon, little bit of almond butter that I say from this morning, put that on top yummy, yummy. Sounds good. We'll show you how we make a protein protein Power fruit. I'm gonna take some legal. This is my favorite. Gonna put half of that excluded the bacon. So sata. And then, uh, we're gonna get this little bowl, add a little bit of water, mix it up, mash it up and then I'm gonna peel the apples, boil them little apple sauce out of it to go on like this one a little bit of once. Once he was a little almond butter and a little cinnamon on top of the uh, All right. So once you put the water and you see it's kind of like a, uh, like a dope or whatever. You know what I'm gonna do? Trying to shape the dough and squeeze it all together and to make, to make too little dangerous. I mean, while we're cooking this year, why I seem so staged. What? Hey, hey, look at this. No, look at that. What's up? So usually good. No, you never know. You turn the heat on. I didn't touch the drag me on composting. No, I didn't have a sleep number bed in my state, scores are usually 90-93, 14. Yeah, I don't sleep. Cold air goes to the gym and it's cold. I can't breathe. I swear in my life, I swear in everybody's life on a stack of bibles around and whatever. I did not touch it. I did not. You just want on its own today. We'll see you later for a movie. Yeah. All right. So what you do is basically when you mold them into a little ball, like two balls here, it's as simple as like squishing them down. That kind of looks like a cookie. And then because I'm gonna put stuff on it, I'm gonna put all the apple sauce. It's like a cooking show, right? I'm a poker player, not like chef already. You can stuff. So I'm gonna make like a crust that we'll go in the oven and it'll harden Both of them like that. Something like this finesse and whatever. And it comes out nice and crispy. You take a little parchment paper and thinking like this. I like to repeat it. 425 it up to you, depending how crispy want it, throw this in here for 20 minutes. Uh are still here. All right. So there we go and put that in for 20 minutes. And while that's happening, we chop up some apples. Is my audience right spot you excited for cobb Oh yeah. Just to lay on the beach. Yeah. You got a plan. Just hurry up. Oh yeah, I'm gonna put you in, you know your money? It's not money. Oh my God, I've forgotten. I want to. Yeah, it's probably a 25 day. You can read by the three times you. Let me read it three times. Thank you. I'm not playing this, but I'll play the little ones. I've played a little interview last year. Remember we got to block the next, the next thing. People really good at the same table and actually I was in a different room households. Right, right, so here we go. We got the apples boil it up here, appeals will put them in there, Keep that another 5, 10 minutes to mash them up with this guy right here with the salmon on top and young still we're almost ready. So we got one tablespoon teaspoon of almond butter spread up on those two melting on top. We got apples, cinnamon or put that on top of those. And young young sure you could drink a protein shake but I'd rather eat mine. Hello? Um Your whole extra on the side. Mhm. No. Yeah, I love doing this. It's too much. I feel like I'm a baker now. Like I've learned some stuff during this quarantine baking, like baking one on one. So he's baking powder does. So one of the things that uh this quarantine has done for me and what it's really like in full usage of the house. We don't we haven't left, we didn't leave, I left for the first time just a few days ago, go outside of that. Uh We literally never left the house and definitely use some more of it. So typically on a day like this after a workout, jump in the pool for a bit, relax. A lot of people wonder about spray tan. Now I live in Vegas, you double sun up there and then it's involved on the putting green. Later we'll have some balls, like some actual swings, working on something real good christian, my golf guy boom smacking and hitting it pretty good. So that'll be the and then of course we'll do 10,000 steps a day. That's one of the parts of the program I'm doing is just walk nothing crazy. We'll go on the treadmill. I'll probably bring my laptop up there and I'll play online poker. I've been playing a lot of online poker, a private couple private games with some buddies and stuff like that. A lot of mixed games playing 11 game mix, Another one like 4 or five game mix. So that's been uh fun and a good way to keep me sharp since the World Series is coming around, I'm gonna probably start playing some uh no limit hold'em tournaments on there just so I can get comfortable with the software and the whole deal and get back into the swing of things with element. But for now time for a little bacon in the beautiful 105 degree weather. He's all excited and cute. Get a little dance, do the dance thing again.
