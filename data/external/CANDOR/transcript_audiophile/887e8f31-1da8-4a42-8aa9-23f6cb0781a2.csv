And I don't like that, that people are putting pressure on the government to try and reopen as a, as a matter like that, they're politicizing the issue as an infringement on their personal rights and liberties because public health, like we pay people like you to tell us what to do in these times of grave crisis, right? Because we don't all have that sort of textbook knowledge that you studied and we need the guidance of people who understand it from an epidemiological perspective, who understand it from a geographical perspective, you know, and who can take these different disciplines and put them together.

I think they're just going to give it up and they're going to want their baseball back and they're going to want their concerts back and they're going to want to go back to work and eventually they're going to put so much pressure on the local level politicians that they're going to get some version of that.
