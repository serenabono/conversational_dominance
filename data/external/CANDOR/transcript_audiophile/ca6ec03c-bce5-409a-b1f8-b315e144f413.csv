Um Down here there's only two tests, one in fifth grade and then one in eighth grade. So like my 12 year old this year, she had to take the test for the state. That test just make sure that she's up to the fifth grade level so that she can move on to the junior high kind of um middle school part of it. Then at eighth grade she'll have another test and then she'll be able to go move on to high school. But most counties in most states it's super easy. You just go into office and ask them for the home school papers or um I say I printed them off and then I took him into the county office and she gave me a time cheat make a time. So you'd get in a factory and She said just fill this in every day, bring it back to me at the end of the year before June one and that's all you have to do and that's all I did.
