In most ways, it was very much like any other town. It had a Main Street lined with stores, houses with trees and gardens around them, a schoolhouse, about three hundred people, and some assorted cats and dogs. But there were no food stores in the town of Chewandswallow. They didn't need any. The sky supplied all the food they ever could possibly want. The only thing that was really different about Chewandswallow was its weather. It came three times a day, at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Everything that everyone ate came from the sky. Whatever the weather served, that was what they ate. But it never rained rain, it never snowed snow, it never just blew wind. It rained things like soup and juice, it snowed mashed potatoes and green peas,” ew, “and sometimes the wind blew in storms of hamburgers.”",4800,160.0,2019-04-13 09:55:02,

When the townspeople went outside, they carried their plates, cups, glasses, forks, spoons, knives and napkins with them. That way they would always be prepared for any kind of weather. If there were leftovers, and there usually were, the people took them home, put them in their refrigerator, in case they got hungry in between meals. The menu varied. By the time they woke up in the morning, breakfast was coming down. After a brief shower of orange juice, low clouds of sunny side up eggs moved in, followed by pieces of toast. Butter and jellies sprinkled down for the toast. And most of the time, it sprinkled milk afterwards.”",6960,232.0,2019-04-13 09:56:14,
