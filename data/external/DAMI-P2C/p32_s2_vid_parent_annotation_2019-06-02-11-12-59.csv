It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right; it could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight.

Then the Who's young and old will sit down to a feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, and they'd feast, feast, feast, feast! They'd feast on Who pudding and rare Who roast beast, which was something the Grinch couldn't stand in the least.",5880,196.0,2019-06-02 11:16:19,

They'd sing, and they'd sing, and they'd sing, sing, sing, sing!

All the Who's were all dreaming sweet dreams without care, when he came to the first little house on the square. “This is stop number one,” the old Grinch Claus hissed, and he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist. Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch. But if Santa could do, then so could the Grinch. He got stuck only once for a moment or two, then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue, where the little Who stockings all hung in a row. “These stockings,” he grinned, “are the first things to go!”",12450,415.0,2019-06-02 11:19:58,

Pop guns and bicycles, roller skates, drums, checkerboards, tricycles, popcorn, and plums. And he stuffed them in bags, then the Grinch very nimbly, stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimney. Then he slunk to the icebox, he took the Who's feast, he took Who pudding, he took the roast beast. He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash. Why, that Grinch even took their last can of Who hash.",14190,473.0,2019-06-02 11:20:56,

And the Grinch grabbed the tree, and he started to shove when he heard a small sound like the coo of a dove. He turned around fast, and he saw a small Who, little Cindy Lou Who, who was not more than two. The Grinch had been caught by this tiny Who daughter, who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water. She stared at the Grinch and said, ""Santa Claus, why? Why are you taking our Christmas tree? Why?"" But you know that old Grinch was so smart and so slick. He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick.",16050,535.0,2019-06-02 11:21:58,

So I'm taking it home to my workshop my dear. I'll fix it up there, then I'll bring it back here."" And his fib fooled the child, and he patted her head, and he got her a drink, and he sent her to bed. And while Cindy Lou Who went to bed with her cup, he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up. Then the last thing he took was the log for their fire, then he went up the chimney himself, the old liar. On their walls, he left nothing but hooks and some wire. And the one speck of food that he left in the house, was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse. Then, he did the same thing to the other Who's houses, leaving crumbs much too small for the other Who's mouses.",17970,599.0,2019-06-02 11:23:02,

He rode with his load to the tip-top to dump it. ""Pooh-pooh to the Who's!"" He was grinchishly humming. ""They're finding out now that no Christmas is coming! They're just waking up!
