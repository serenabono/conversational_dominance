She couldn't believe that two days ago everyone liked her. Now, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her. Her father tried to make her feel better. “Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart?” he asked. “No, thank you,” sighed Camilla. What she really wanted was a nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day. You going to turn it? Do you need a tissue.

It was very uncomfortable. “Well. Its not the mumps,” concluded Dr. Grop. “Or the measles,” said Dr. Sponge. “Definitely not chicken pox,” put in Dr. Cricket. “Or sunburn,” said Dr. Young. “Try these,” said the Specialists.

Dr. Gourd and Mr. Mellon were the finest scientific minds in the land. Once again, Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to. The Experts wrote down lots of numbers. Then they huddled together and whispered. Dr. Gourd finally spoke. “It might be a virus,” he announced with authority. Suddenly, fuzzy little virus balls appeared all over Camilla. “Or possibly some form of bacteria,” said Mr. Mellon.

Slowly, she started to melt into the walls of her room. Her bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresser, and two paintings were her eyes. The therapist screamed and ran from the house. “What are we going to do?” cried Mrs. Cream. “It just keeps getting worse and worse!” She began to cry. At that moment, Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door. He opened it, and there stool an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry. “Excuse me,” she said brightly. “But I think I can help.” She went into Camilla's room and looked around. “My goodness,” she said with a shake of her head. “What we have here is a bad case of stripes.

Camilla wanted a big, heaping plateful of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it. “Yuck!” she said. “No one likes lima beans, especially me!”“Oh, dear,” the old woman said sadly. “I guess I was wrong about you.” She put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door. Camilla watched the old woman walk away. Those beans would taste so good. And being laughed at for eating them was nothing, compared to what she’d been going through. She finally couldn't stand it. “Wait!” she cried. “The truth is…I really love lima beans.” “I thought so,” the old woman said with a smile.

Then she went outside and vanished into the crowd. Afterward, Camilla wasn't quite the same. Some of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn't care a bit.
