[Speaker A]: Plus, the assignments were quite complex. I had to spend a lot of time on them.
[Speaker B]: Yes, but I think the discussion forums were helpful. I could ask questions and get answers from other students.
[Speaker A]: True, but it's not the same as asking a teacher directly.
[Speaker B]: That's true. But I think the flexibility of the course was a big advantage.
