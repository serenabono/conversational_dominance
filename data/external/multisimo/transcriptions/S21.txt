M003_S21:  which means of transport?
P045:  hmm
M003_S21:  Related to the airport.

P045:  I would go for bus or some sort of metro +[oh]
P045:  yeah.
M003_S21:  Somethi +[ii] ng
P045:  You were thinking probably of the plane itself.
M003_S21:  Plane, that's that's one answer actually. #1 yeah #
P045:  #2 Yes. #
M003_S21:  So you need to find two more.

P045:  #2 mhmm #
M003_S21:  So now you need to talk to each other in order to order these answers in terms of popularity.
P045:  Ok.
P044:  Well I vote for the kindergarten and school cause
P045:  I think

M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P045:  #1 Yeah. #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P045:  I think I will agree in the sense that p most people that have children would would say first the school. So yeah I think school is #1 would be #
P044:  #2 Yeah. #
P045:  first answer.
P045:  Now the other two were?
P044:  Hospital and the plane.
P045:  Hospital and the plane.
P045:  I would say first hospital, because most people go to hospitals unless people travel.
P044:  #1 I agree with that. #
P045:  #2 But # You agree?
P044:  And there's so many people like like I mean li the number #1 increases #
P045:  #2 yeah #
P044:  like people coming coming and giving it so +[oh]
P044:  the number of the potential people are
P045:  #1 hmm #
P044:  #2 who are sick # they're increasing all the time.
P045:  Yes.
P044:  In the plane you have this like limited number
P045:  #1 mhmm #
P044:  #2 like it's # not growing it's just that fixed number.
P045:  Ok.
P044:  I guess so.
P045:  #1 So +[oh] #
P044:  #2 Other thing #
P045:  we go we g I I agree we go with that?
P044:  #1 Yeah. #
P045:  #2 [eh] #
P044:  #1 I agree. #
P045:  #2 School [eh] # hospital
P044:  and this plane
P045:  and plane.
M003_S21:  Brilliant, that's correct. #1 Well done. #
P044:  #2 Ok. #
M003_S21:  #1 Very good. #
P044:  #2 [laugh] #
M003_S21:  [eh] Ready for the second one?
P045:  mhmm
M003_S21:  #1 Yeah? #
P044:  #2 Ok. #
M003_S21:  Can you name an instrument you can find in a symphony orchestra.
P045:  Ok.
P044:  Harp?
P045:  You'll #1 go for harp. #
P044:  #2 Since # since we're in #1 Ireland, I guess the harp is the #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P044:  #1 first #
P045:  #2 yeah #
P044:  #1 one that comes to mind. #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P045:  I would go for [eh] for violin.
M003_S21:  Violin is the right one yeah.
P044:  Yeah.
P045:  And we need a third one no?
M003_S21:  You need two.
P045:  Two.
M003_S21:  Two more #1 yeah. #
P045:  #2 Two more # #1 [e] #
P044:  #2 [eh] #
P044:  There should be definitely be [eh]
P044:  hmm violin [eh]
M003_S21:  There is another one with strings.
P045:  Yeah.
P044:  The big one the big
M003_S21:  #1 yeah #
P044:  #2 one well # #1 I just can't remember #
P045:  #2 you can go for the # cello? #1 or the +[eh] #
M003_S21:  #2 yeah #
P045:  #1 [eh] #
P044:  #2 cello is # #1 that one ce cello cello #
M003_S21:  #2 is that that's correct. # Very good. So you need to find one more. Which is quite different from this instrument.
P045:  Ok.
M003_S21:  No strings.
P044:  #1 I think #
P045:  #2 No strings. #
P044:  something blowing?
P045:  Could be. That I I to be honest I don't remember if piano is considered the +[eh] symphonic orchestra. #1 [eh] no. #
M003_S21:  #2 No it's not. # It's not in in the three answers.
P045:  So [eh]
P045:  Clarinet?
P045:  It's a bit not that close. [eh]
P044:  It's not a string so
M003_S21:  You might hit it.
P045:  Hit it?
M003_S21:  Yeah.
P045:  Yes. So #1 drums #
P044:  #2 Drums? #
M003_S21:  #1 Drums yeah very good. #
P045:  #2 hm hmm hm #
M003_S21:  So you have three answers. Can you +[oo] order them now in terms of popularity please?
P044:  Violin is the first I guess.
P045:  Yes, probably violin would be first.
P044:  Yeah.
P044:  Well
P045:  #1 now #
P044:  #2 maybe # drum
P044:  Now I think it's drum could be more #1 like yeah #
P045:  #2 more popular? #
P044:  cause
P044:  I mean
P044:  if you s think of this way like you don't see people like mostly like playing and the violin #1 I mean #
P045:  #2 hmm #
P044:  there are violin players are less than the drum players
P045:  Yes.
P044:  I guess so. So, I would say the drum is the first.
P045:  But on the +[eh] for example in the orchestra [eh] the second person in charge a after the +[eh] the master is the vio the fi the first violinist
P044:  Ok then
P045:  #1 and is also #
P044:  #2 if #
P045:  on the +[eh] on the front let's say of the of the orchestra and the drum is is always in the
P044:  #1 Yeah in the #
P045:  #2 back. # So, in that sense probably people would associate violin with the +[eh] picture of an orchestra playing.
P044:  Ok.
P044:  But then the cello is always in this middle in the centre since #1 it's big one #
P045:  #2 yes #
P044:  #1 yeah #
M003_S21:  #2 hmm #
P044:  and and and and yeah I have I don't have deep knowledge of that #1 [laugh] #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P044:  #1 [laugh] #
P045:  #2 ah ok #
P044:  of the music stuff you know [ts] .
P045:  So [eh] we fix violin first?
P044:  #1 ok but #
P045:  #2 and and discuss # which goes second is cello or the +[eh] or the drum?
P044:  Well, I I +[ii] support your point that that drums are always in the back
P045:  yes
P044:  I think that makes a sense to put even the third place
P045:  The third place.
P044:  Makes a sense to me.
P045:  So you go for violin, cello, drum.
P044:  Yeah.
P045:  [eh]
P045:  I see why +[ii] why cello why wh drum is not first, a at least in my opinion, but I would go for violin drum and and then cello.
P044:  Ah
P045:  Because ok somehow you have the violin that it should be there because it's the it's the it's the boss after the +[eh] the maestro but then what you always assume that is there is some sort of rhythm. So, the second thing that you would say a as far as I think would be drum. That definitely there should there should be drum there. And then the cello +[oh] I think le ll least the least people would think of cello.
P044:  Yeah I I would rely on your opinion cause I have this as I don't have the #1 deep knowledge of that. #
M003_S21:  #2 hmm #
P044:  I mean I love music especially the classical music but I never pay attention #1 on how they how they are [un] #
M003_S21:  #2 yeah exactly it's difficult. # Yeah.
P044:  I just love it I just love to listen.
M003_S21:  Yeah.
P044:  and give attention there.
P045:  So we +[ii] we go with this ordering? #1 eh #
P044:  #2 I oh # I agree with that why not.
M003_S21:  Almost #1 right #
P045:  #2 Almost #
M003_S21:  #1 almost. #
P045:  #2 right #
M003_S21:  So violin is first
P045:  #1 Mhmm. #
M003_S21:  #2 Then it's # cello and then is drum.
P045:  ok
M003_S21:  But you did well, you almost found it.
P045:  #1 Yeah #

P045:  Let's go for bread.
P044:  Ok. They cut #1 and #
M003_S21:  #2 [eh] ts #
P044:  #1 they slice the #
P045:  #2 I hope ths was not the popular answer. #
M003_S21:  It's not bread but it's something related to food.
P045:  food
M003_S21:  #1 So +[oh] #
P044:  #2 Cheese. #
M003_S21:  hmm
P044:  What they cut?
P045:  [eh] hm
M003_S21:  It's like a main ingredient.
P045:  Probably meat.
M003_S21:  Meat, that's correct.
P045:  Yes.
M003_S21:  Very good. So now you have one last answer left, you have to find another one.
P044:  #1 So paper #
P045:  #2 So up to now # paper, meat
P044:  What they can
P044:  it's a tangible, right? It's like straight away and so
M003_S21:  [laugh] yeah
P044:  #1 What people #
M003_S21:  #2 And think # of appearance for example, what would both
P044:  #1 Hair? #
M003_S21:  #2 men and # #1 women, yeah. #
P045:  #2 Ah, hair. # Hair.
P044:  #1 Hair. #
M003_S21:  #2 That's # great. #1 So you have #
P045:  #2 mhmm #
M003_S21:  all three answers. Can you order them now in terms of popularity?
P044:  I say this way pa [ah] meat, hair and k paper.
P044:  so
P044:  like
P044:  if you are not a vegetarian you would #1 cut meat everyday. #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P045:  hm
P044:  I'm not a vegetarian.
P045:  So you +[oo] well meat hair and eh pa
P044:  #1 paper #
P045:  #2 per #
P044:  Oh in this digital world you don't cut the paper so much.
P045:  Yeah yeah.
M003_S21:  hmm
P044:  I'll just think of new things so.
P045:  I thhhhhink I would
P045:  I I would go for haircut fir hair [eh] cut first because haircut is a very common word so I think that although we for us it took time to to think of hair
P045:  it it it's some thought that most people would do directly this cut this association of cut and haircut.
P044:  Ok.
P045:  [eh]
P045:  But I'm not sure. The thing there is also the word papercut to describe it when you get cut by by a paper, so I w even if somebody would say +[ii] mention the word cut you might may consider the association with papercut.
P044:  Which is cutting the paper itself? Not, being #1 cut with the paper. #
P045:  #2 Yes. #
P045:  But then
P044:  Well
P044:  And I as a as I'm not a vegetarian I as I the meat I cut the meat every day
P045:  #1 yeah #
P044:  #2 so # for me that stands for first I'm not stylish
P045:  hmm
M003_S21:  #1 hmm #
P044:  #2 I don't go to the # #1 barber everyday #
P045:  #2 hmm #
P044:  #1 so #
M003_S21:  #2 hmm #
P045:  #1 ah yeah #
P044:  #2 [laugh] # once a month #1 maybe #
M003_S21:  #2 hmm #
P044:  twi w t t #1 once in a month #
P045:  #2 so we # we fix it like [eh] meat hair and [eh]
P044:  Well, I can dis we can discuss about the th hair and the paper but I th I I would put #1 the meat #
P045:  #2 hmm #
P044:  I mean #1 of the #
P045:  #2 oh yeah #
P044:  three I would put the meat in the first place.
P045:  You have some reason to believe that paper would be more popular than #1 hair? Ok. #
P044:  #2 No, I just want #
P045:  #1 Ah, ah. #
P044:  #2 ch to discuss if you have # d if you disagree with.
P045:  Ah oh no. No, I think then we can go for meat [eh] , hair and [eh] #1 then paper. #
P044:  #2 Ok. # Ok. Works for me.
M003_S21:  Yeah? [i]
P044:  No?
M003_S21:  #1 Almost there, first is hair #
P044:  #2 [laugh] #
M003_S21:  then it's paper then it's meat.
P045:  Last is meat
M003_S21:  #1 Last yeah. #
P045:  #2 eh yeah. #
M003_S21:  #1 But that's #
P044:  #2 But I guess #
M003_S21:  very interesting the thinking process #1 you know? #
P045:  #2 hmm #
P044:  But I think the most few people they're maybe they were like females #1 [un] #
M003_S21:  #2 [laugh] #
P044:  their haircuts
M003_S21:  #1 [laugh] #
P044:  #2 does in the fir # rst place
M003_S21:  Yeah.
P044:  #1 I think. #
M003_S21:  #2 It was a random # sample, I don't know more about it. #1 But #
P045:  #2 hmm #
M003_S21:  #1 it's very interesting ah? #
P044:  #2 [laugh] #
M003_S21:  Your thinking process was very intere #1 sting. #
P044:  #2 [laugh] #
M003_S21:  Ok well done guys. #1 Thanks very much I hope you #
P045:  #2 Ok, thanks. #
M003_S21:  #1 enjoyed it. #
P044:  #2 Thanks. #
