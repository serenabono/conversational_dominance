M001_S05:  Ok hi welcome, thank you for coming today. We're going to play a quiz. I would like to ask you three questions which were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions.
P013:  Ok.
M001_S05:  #1 Ok? #
P012:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S05:  And then I will ask you to talk to each other [eh]+ and guess the ranking of the answers in terms of popularity. So for example if I say +[ii] [eh] what are some ways in which you can pe carry patients to the hospital you would say things like an ambulance, wheelchair, patient's bed ok? #1 And then you would #
P012:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S05:  try to see to find which one of these were you know was the most popular answer and so on
P013:  #1 Is it #
P012:  #2 mhmm #
P013:  [eh] are they gonna be general questions [ms] or it's something where it depends on the audience what #1 would be the #
M001_S05:  #2 uhuh #
P013:  most likely
M001_S05:  #1 hm #
P013:  #2 answer #
M001_S05:  hm It was just a group of one hundred participants [eh]+ and #1 they #
P013:  #2 mixed #
M001_S05:  #1 yes #
P012:  #2 yeah # #1 su #
P013:  #2 ok #
M001_S05:  #1 So #
P012:  #2 pposed to be # a random sample.
M001_S05:  Exactly #1 so we don't ha #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S05:  ve a specific profile of these #1 participants #
P012:  #2 ok #
M001_S05:  is that ok?
P013:  Yeah.
M001_S05:  #1 Do you have any other #
P012:  #2 Yeah. #
M001_S05:  questions?
P012:  hmm I mean they there won't be any +[ii] I mean
M001_S05:  #1 no #
P012:  #2 we won't # have the question written or a
M001_S05:  #1 No I will just give #
P012:  #2 nything ah #
M001_S05:  them to you [eh] orally and then you will have the opportunity to discuss I would really like you to work together.
P013:  Ok.
M001_S05:  And have a discussion before you're able to give y me your final decisions. Is that ok?
P013:  #1 Yeah. #
P012:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S05:  Right.
M001_S05:  So, the first think I would like you to name is a public place where you would be more likely to catch [eh] f the flu or a cold.
P012:  hmm #1 [eh] #
P013:  #2 [eh] #
P012:  The the bus?
P013:  Yeah
P012:  #1 s some #
P013:  #2 yeah #
P012:  thing like yeah?
P013:  #1 [eh] #
P012:  #2 [eh] #
M001_S05:  I mean [eh] it's eh that was not one of the ah that's a good idea
P012:  #1 hmm #
M001_S05:  #2 it's it wasn't # one of the most popular answers but think about other means of transport.
P012:  [ah]
P012:  #1 hm #
P013:  #2 [eh] # Airplane I think
M001_S05:  #1 Excellent #
P013:  #2 airplane. #
M001_S05:  #1 very good #
P013:  #2 yeah #
M001_S05:  #1 yeah. #
P012:  #2 hmm #
M001_S05:  So you have one, you need two more now.
P013:  [eh]
P012:  #1 [eh] #
P013:  #2 [eh] #
P013:  #1 So +[oh] #
P012:  #2 hmm # The t there is a train as well but
M001_S05:  Well the +[ii] other two answers are not really means of transport.
P012:  oh #1 ok #
P013:  #2 [un] [ah] #
P012:  ok
M001_S05:  So think about other public places.
P013:  Well like schools and [eh]
M001_S05:  #1 hmm #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  You know like [ah] daycare kind of sort of
M001_S05:  Excellent, very good. So school is an the other one, yeah?
P012:  Well eh
P012:  I don't know you you can get it also like in a hospital #1 but I'm not sure #
M001_S05:  #2 Excellent #
P012:  #1 yeah well #
M001_S05:  #2 yes indeed # yeah.
P012:  #1 ok #
M001_S05:  #2 So that # was the other answer. So you have the three, would you like us to would you like to have a quick chat about the popularity of these answers #1 so what's #
P013:  #2 the +[eh] #
M001_S05:  what's the most popular answer?
P012:  So it's eh So it's hospital, school and airplane.
P013:  mhmm
P012:  So
P012:  [ah]
P012:  Maybe school?
P013:  Yeah be
P012:  #1 but #
P013:  #2 cause y y # young
P012:  #1 because #
P013:  #2 like a #
P012:  it's yeah young child
P013:  #1 children yeah #
P012:  #2 dren # but but hospital you have more mixed [eh] but I don't know
P013:  [ah]
P012:  hm
P013:  Yeah but you can I d I don't know I'm not sure whether you you you know you catch more sickness when you're already sick you know sort of eh
P012:  hmm
P013:  Cause it feels li I don't know for me it feels like that you know in schools because especially parents they tend to send their children to #1 school when they're sick #
P012:  #2 yeah #
P013:  and then it's just kind of [ah]
P013:  you know y #1 you know it was sort of kind of [un] and stuff #
P012:  #2 yeah when one is sick # yeah
P013:  I don't know like I don't I don't have the impression I mean cause I know a few people working [eh] hospitals and that they got sick that often so you you I mean you have people coming to visit but I mean you have people already #1 sick #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  #1 so you can't #
P012:  #2 yeah #
P013:  count them in and then you know you have people that [eh]
P012:  #1 yeah I think I would go with #
P013:  #2 that sort of [un] #
P012:  with school as well as the the f the most popular
P013:  yeah
P012:  yeah
P013:  [eh]
P012:  god hm
P013:  I think well the airplane is also I just heard that you [ah] you are I don't know maybe it's because you're kind of in a closed space maybe the +[eh] sanitary kind of conditions are not great I don't know.
P012:  mhmm
P013:  [ah]
P013:  I just heard that you know so and then I think it's how to say it like I once traveled with a cold and it really aggravates your cold I think, so d you know you tend to feel like I think it tends to be more painful than say train travel I think but I'm not sure whether that actually affects you know #1 be more infectious. #
P012:  #2 Yeah but # because in airplane most likely to be you know [ah] adults.
P012:  They might not you know try to you know cover the +[eh] their mouth or [ah] having baby that might not [ah]
P012:  be as
P012:  [ah] not dangerous but [eh] give a risk of infection as children who will just you know touch everything and #1 every #
P013:  #2 yeah #
P012:  one.
P013:  But at the same time like I think you you're more likely to travel when you're sick.
P013:  I mean by by airplane because you know you already booked a plane and you know unless you've got insurance and you [un] you're gonna #1 cancel the flight #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  I think.
P013:  So I I at least I would be more likely to travel by by plane when I'm sick I don't know I don't know by bus or by train or something because it's something you can avoid #1 sort of. #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  [ah] I don't know I'm not sure whether it it
M001_S05:  #1 But are you talking about the #
P012:  #2 Eh no #
M001_S05:  probability +[ii] where eh you would have more chances I mean
M001_S05:  are you trying to think about the +[eh] ho you know probability of getting sick or are you looking at the popularity of the answers?
P013:  [eh]
M001_S05:  #1 So +[oh] #
P013:  #2 Well ob # viously there's a reasoning about I think it's #1 more likely that #
M001_S05:  #2 hmm #
P013:  you know #1 get sick #
M001_S05:  #2 hmm #
P013:  of then #1 it's maybe some #
M001_S05:  #2 right #
P013:  ing that'll be you know
M001_S05:  ok
P013:  [eh]
M001_S05:  #1 hmm #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  [eh]
P013:  I don't know maybe +[ii] #1 maybe #
P012:  #2 I don't know #
P013:  hospitals yeah maybe that 'll be more int intuitive I don't know eh
P012:  Yeah I I honestly [un] #1 [laugh] #
M001_S05:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  #1 [eh] I don't think airplane would pro necessa #
P013:  #2 [eh] [un] # rily be a popular answer I think
P013:  #1 in that I think it's logic I don't think #
P012:  #2 yes so +[oh] #
P013:  it's necessarily very b gonna be very popular
P012:  So +[oh]
M001_S05:  So what would be your final ranking then?
P013:  I'd say hos #1 pitals befo #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  re airplanes I don't know
M001_S05:  #1 And would the top #
P012:  #2 hm I I # then I would you know #1 hospital before #
P013:  #2 top would be +[ii] #
P012:  #1 airplane would in first would be schools yeah #
P013:  #2 bef and school yeah yeah #
M001_S05:  So, is it schools, hospitals and airplanes?
P013:  Yeah.
P012:  Yeah.
M001_S05:  Excellent, you got it. That was the right ranking #1 very good. #
P012:  #2 Ok. #
P013:  Ok.
M001_S05:  [eh] Now let's move on to the second question. I would like you to name an instrument in a symphony orchestra.
P013:  [eh]
P012:  oh
P013:  Violin.
P012:  eh
M001_S05:  Very good #1 that's one #
P013:  #2 [eh] #
M001_S05:  #1 yeah. #
P013:  #2 Cello. #
M001_S05:  Excellent, yes.
P012:  and eh
M001_S05:  One more?
P012:  eh
P012:  Bass?
P012:  but
M001_S05:  #1 hmm no #
P012:  #2 [i] I've a # not a very
P012:  yeah here again my English #1 [laugh] is lacking sligh #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  tly [ah]
M001_S05:  #1 Well this is a #
P012:  #2 [ah] the flute? #
M001_S05:  simple [eh] I would like you to think about instruments that are commonly used in even in live concert concerts or you know different #1 types of music #
P012:  #2 maybe a flu # te?
M001_S05:  #1 hmm #
P012:  #2 hm # No?
M001_S05:  No but try again.
P012:  #1 hmm #
P013:  #2 [ah] #
P013:  But it wouldn't be kind of extravagant like an ha a harp or
M001_S05:  #1 No #
P013:  #2 something #
M001_S05:  I mean it's a common English word cause you v because you mentioned your limited vocabulary about #1 instruments #
P012:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S05:  the +[eh] I mean this musical #1 instrument is #
P012:  #2 hmm #
M001_S05:  very commonly used in English, it's a common #1 simple word. #
P012:  #2 ok # so
P013:  Like a +[ah]
P012:  [ah]
P013:  trumpet?
M001_S05:  Nope.
P013:  No.
M001_S05:  It allows you to give the rhythm the melody #1 as well. #
P013:  #2 [oh] # ok
P012:  hmm
P012:  I guess so eh a drum?
M001_S05:  Yes #1 that's it #
P012:  #2 yeah #
M001_S05:  very good. #1 So #
P012:  #2 ok #
M001_S05:  you now have the three ok? #1 Would you like #
P013:  #2 hmm #
M001_S05:  us [eh] would you like to talk about their ranking?
P012:  Oh ok so you said #1 So [eh] #
P013:  #2 So we #
P012:  #1 [eh] #
P013:  #2 ah in terms # popularity then [ah]
M001_S05:  mhmm
P012:  Maybe violin #1 would be #
P013:  #2 yeah #
P012:  the first #1 ye #
M001_S05:  #2 hmm #
P012:  #1 ah #
P013:  #2 yeah # I think so
P012:  yeah
P013:  [eh] I think that's very +[ii]
P012:  Yeah violin
P012:  and then cello and then drum? Because it's it's [ah] I thought of violin, just couldn't catch the word #1 in English [laugh] so #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  [ah]
P012:  and yeah
P012:  I don't know if you agree.
P013:  [eh]
P012:  #1 I I'm not sure the #
P013:  #2 yeah #
P012:  last two but
P013:  Yeah I think it's probably what people would think of [ah] cause I don't really think of like drums I mean they're kind of they're more on the background I think #1 like #
P012:  #2 hmm #
P013:  I think everything that gives rhythm is not I mean i it's obviously very necessary but at the same time it's it's not very
M001_S05:  hm
P012:  hm
M001_S05:  prominent
P013:  yeah and I think it's better because you know cellos tend to be quite big as well I th and also #1 and #
P012:  #2 yeah #
P013:  usually I think they're placed in front of the +[eh] #1 you know from the stage you know so #
P012:  #2 yeah in front yeah yeah #
P013:  drums they tend to be at the side or at the back I think
P012:  #1 hmm #
P013:  #2 sort of # [ah] so it wouldn't be as visible I'd say.
M001_S05:  So what would be your final decision?
P012:  #1 [ah] #
P013:  #2 [ah] #
P012:  #1 yeah #
P013:  #2 yeah vi #
P012:  like #1 ah violin #
P013:  #2 violin, cello and then #
P012:  #1 yeah #
P013:  #2 [ah] #
M001_S05:  You're #1 very good. #
P012:  #2 and then drum. # yeah
M001_S05:  Well done
P012:  #1 [laugh] [laugh] #
M001_S05:  #2 you got it #
P012:  #1 hmm #
M001_S05:  #2 very good. #
M001_S05:  So now the third and the final question, I would like you to name something that people cut.
P013:  cut
M001_S05:  Things that #1 people cut. #
P012:  #2 Cut? # #1 [laugh] #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  #1 [laugh] #

P012:  #1 I I I I #
M001_S05:  #2 ok #
P012:  came with apple but eh #1 ah #
M001_S05:  #2 Well think about # food but l think about a different category of food
M001_S05:  not foo [eh] fruit or vegetables.
P013:  Eh meat?
M001_S05:  Very good yeah. #1 That that #
P012:  #2 So #

M001_S05:  #2 yeah #
P012:  ok so
P013:  Bread?
M001_S05:  I mean ok meat is one answer but the +[eh] n forget about the food #1 now move to other things #
P013:  #2 ok ok #
P012:  #1 ok #
P013:  #2 that was just a food item #
P012:  #1 ok #
M001_S05:  #2 yeah #
P012:  #1 [eh] #
P013:  #2 Wood? #
M001_S05:  [i] #1 y #

M001_S05:  #2 Very good. #
P012:  #1 [laugh] #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S05:  #1 And one more? #
P013:  #2 [eh] #
P012:  Go ahead. #1 I I #
P013:  #2 no no no I'm #
P012:  #1 I feel #
P013:  #2 I don't know #
P012:  like ah
P013:  cut
P012:  #1 [ah] #
P013:  #2 ok so we have # we have meat we have [eh]
P012:  #1 hair #
P013:  #2 hair #
P012:  #1 meat and hair #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  [eh]
P013:  [eh]
P012:  #1 [eh] #
P013:  #2 So we have we have # food and we have something on the
P012:  #1 nai #
P013:  #2 person #
P012:  ls?
P013:  so
P012:  yeah but that's already yeah
P013:  yeah maybe that it has to be something else
P012:  yeah
P013:  [eh]
P013:  So maybe that's something that is not animate [laugh] [laugh] not food [laugh]
P012:  maybe with like scissors, paper? No?
M001_S05:  Paper
P012:  #1 yeah #
M001_S05:  #2 well done #
P012:  #1 yeah #
M001_S05:  #2 yeah #
P012:  #1 ok #
M001_S05:  #2 that was the other # one.
P012:  #1 ok #
M001_S05:  #2 So # in terms of popularity how would you rank these answers?
P013:  I don't think that meat is very popular.
M001_S05:  hm
P012:  #1 nah #
P013:  #2 I think # I think paper would
P012:  #1 hmm #
P013:  #2 probably be very #
P013:  #1 that very popoular answer. #
P012:  #2 Yeah but I think hair # as well is I don't know eh i it's both with scissors so I don't know #1 [ah] #
P013:  #2 [ah] #
P012:  #1 yeah many paper #
P013:  #2 cut hair #
P012:  #1 ah I don't know eh [laugh] sorry [laugh] #
P013:  #2 paper I think I don't know you made me unsure again [laugh] # [eh] yeah I think I think you're right I think meat should probably +[ii] #1 be very close #
P012:  #2 hmm # hmm
P013:  I don't know it's not something that I think you
P013:  #1 that I just I just #
P012:  #2 yeah but #
P013:  tend to think of food and I think #1 that's why I came you know #
P012:  #2 yeah we we # ask me something of cutting eh instantly for food in first not not meat but food #1 so +[oh] it's ah #
P013:  #2 yeah yeah yeah yeah #
P013:  So I think well I don't think it's a popular answer like
P012:  hm
P012:  #1 yeah maybe not #
M001_S05:  #2 What would be # the first thing that would come to most people's minds?
P012:  Maybe I would say hair but I don't know I I didn't follow it now it seems logical now that now that you said it so +[oh]
P013:  Well i don't know I think it's paper actually
P012:  #1 ok #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  #1 [laugh] ok you so you #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  So you would say paper, hair and [eh]
P013:  meat
P012:  meat
M001_S05:  Is that your final decision?
P012:  ok I mean #1 [laugh] sometimes that's [un] #
P013:  #2 [laugh] #
P012:  so #1 yeah yeah #
P013:  #2 [eh] #
P012:  ok
M001_S05:  Ok, well unfortunately you didn't get this one because it it was hair
P012:  #1 first #
P013:  #2 ok #
P012:  #1 ok so #
P013:  #2 Ok so you're actually right yeah yeah. #
M001_S05:  So hair paper and meat.
P013:  Ah.
P012:  Ok.
M001_S05:  Alright?
P012:  Yeah +[laugh]
