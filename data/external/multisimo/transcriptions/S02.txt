M001_S02:  [laugh] Ok so thanks for coming today. [eh] we're going to play a quiz. #1 I would n #
P006:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S02:  I'm going to ask you three questions #1 and I would li #
P007:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S02:  ke you to to that were posed to group of one hundred pend one hundred people and then I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. #1 [i] #
P007:  #2 Ok #
M001_S02:  and then we'll ask you to identify the ranking in terms of popularity. For example if I ask you what is normally used to to transport patients in a hospital you could say th things like ambulance, a wheelchair right? A patient's bed [eh] so is that is that clear? #1 Do you have any ques #
P006:  #2 Ok #
M001_S02:  tions? Nope? Ok.
M001_S02:  Are you ready for the first question?
P007:  mhmm
M001_S02:  I have yeah I have to point out that you really need to talk to each other before you make your final decisions #1 so you nee #
P006:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S02:  d to have a discussion, ok?
P006:  Right.
M001_S02:  Right. So the first question i +[ii] s [eh] where in which public place would you be more likely to catch [eh] a cold or a flu bug.
P007:  A flu bag?
M001_S02:  A flu bug #1 Sorry I'm not pronouncing #
P007:  #2 Oh bug ok. #
M001_S02:  #1 Bug #
P007:  #2 Sorry [laugh] . #
M001_S02:  sorry.
P006:  #1 Which pu #
P007:  #2 Hm. #
M001_S02:  #1 Ex #
P006:  #2 blic place #
M001_S02:  Yes.
P007:  [i] ok Ok.
P006:  #1 A doct #
P007:  #2 So [eh] #
P006:  or's waiting room is that public? #1 [laugh] #
P007:  #2 [laugh] #
P007:  I guess it is yeah so that makes sense somewhere where there's just a lot of people and possibly outdoors so something like a park.
P006:  Yeah.
P007:  #1 So #
P006:  #2 Or # a public school would they count? #1 Are they kind of indoors? #
P007:  #2 Yeah actually I think a school would # be better again #1 it's real #
P006:  #2 [ms] yeah #
P007:  close together and stuff.
P006:  Good.
P007:  [eh]
P007:  and I'm just thinking I've a friend who got sick lately
P007:  after [ah] working in a restaurant but I don't think people generally get sick in restaurants.
P006:  Well #1 Depends on the kind #
P007:  #2 [laugh] #
P006:  #1 of restaurant #
M001_S02:  #2 [laugh] # #1 [laugh] #
P007:  #2 Yeah. #
P006:  #1 [eh] #
P007:  #2 [eh] #
P006:  Yeah that's kinda tricky how you should [un] it
P007:  #1 Yeah #
P006:  #2 As is # is there are there any parameters going from it like does it have to be an open public pla #1 ce or #
M001_S02:  #2 Not really. #
P007:  #1 Ok. #
P006:  #2 Ok. #
P007:  #1 what like #
P006:  #2 Maybe #
P007:  a swimming pool be a weird answer or would it make sense?
P006:  Would that make infections and things like that for the #1 m like #
P007:  #2 Yeah #
P006:  funguses and toe things and #1 Awful stuff like that. #
P007:  #2 Yeah exactly. #
P006:  [i] [eh] Yeah that was tricky. I I'd say school because everyone is always getting #1 sick at school. #
P007:  #2 Yeah. #
P006:  Or anywhere you're working in close proximity to someone.
P007:  Yeah.
P006:  But [eh]
P007:  Me too though I think the doctor's waiting room is a pretty good one
P007:  and then a school #1 and then #
P006:  #2 Ah yeah #
P007:  like a a bus like public #1 transport. #
P006:  #2 Awh yeah # Sorry I I just touched a bus on the way here and it was so #1 slimy it was gross yeah #
P007:  #2 Gross [laugh] #
P006:  So a bus would be #1 a good one. #
P007:  #2 Yeah. #
P006:  Alright.
P007:  Ok we say that that's a good three
P006:  #1 [ms] fair enough #
P007:  #2 in that case? #
P006:  ok which is the most popular though?
P007:  I think
M001_S02:  Before you #1 can I #
P006:  #2 Oh #
M001_S02:  give you my feedback? #1 Before #
P006:  #2 Yes #
M001_S02:  #1 you decide #
P006:  #2 absolutely #
M001_S02:  do you know about the ranking very good you have the two right? #1 So it's the #
P006:  #2 [r] #
M001_S02:  school
P006:  #1 ok #
P007:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S02:  and then it's [eh] the next one [i] you mentioned the doctor's waiting room can you mention something similar?
M001_S02:  #1 [un] #
P006:  #2 Like a hospital waiting room #
M001_S02:  Exactly. #1 Great. #
P007:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S02:  So a hospital is the second one #1 and #
P007:  #2 ok #
M001_S02:  the third one again well done it's a means of trans port but it's not the b b the bus it's
M001_S02:  #1 a different mean #
P006:  #2 hmm #
M001_S02:  #1 s of transport #
P007:  #2 Is it #
P007:  Is it still public transport?
M001_S02:  We +[eh] ll it's a means of transportation yes it i righ it is #1 I suppose. #
P007:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S02:  [eh]
P007:  Are these people asked in Ireland or
P006:  #1 [laugh] exactly would it be the luas or [laugh] #
P007:  #2 would it be New Yorkers saying the subway or something you know #
M001_S02:  No it's not the subway.
P007:  ok

P006:  #2 the luas #
M001_S02:  tting there you're #1 very close #

P007:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S02:  #1 Yeah but what is #
P007:  #2 I don't [un] #
M001_S02:  the one thing that Irish people love to do #1 How #
P006:  #2 Complain? #
M001_S02:  do they travel
P006:  Oh sorry [eh] #1 [laugh] #
P007:  #2 [laugh] that #
P006:  #1 was under [un] there #
M001_S02:  #2 [laugh] #
P007:  [ah]
P006:  one of our own cars walking
P006:  #1 not walking #
P007:  #2 it makes sen # nse to say in your own car though
P006:  #1 That's not public #
P007:  #2 but it's a public place #
M001_S02:  When people love to escape for fo from Ireland #1 right they want #
P006:  #2 Oh pla # #1 ane of course the recycled #
P007:  #2 Oh plane #
M001_S02:  #1 Excellent #

P006:  #1 So hard [laugh] #
P007:  #2 [laugh] #
P006:  #1 Took us long enough. #
M001_S02:  #2 Now that you have the three most pop # ular answers would you be able to discuss the ranking then?
P006:  #1 Oh god [eh] ! #
P007:  #2 Ok. #
P006:  I suppose by population the number of people that travel on planes as opposed to the people that go to school or
P007:  Yeah exact #1 I think that plane might #
P006:  #2 doctor's waiting room #
P007:  be the third one because it's people who like travel all the time being like oh #1 I hate travelling getting sick on the plane #
P006:  #2 La di daw [laugh] #
P007:  [eh]
P006:  What about doctor's waiting room or hospital waiting rooms? #1 because you're already kinda #
M001_S02:  #2 hmm #
P006:  sick in there.
P007:  Yeah exactly like where does
P007:  So if this is like understanding what people said
P006:  hmm
P007:  [ah] like your mind went to waiting room before it went
P006:  #1 ah well #
P007:  #2 to #
P006:  ugh it's just the super bugs #1 and stuff yeah #
P007:  #2 schools yeah #

P006:  #2 and then plane. # Grand.
P007:  Ok.
P006:  [un]
M001_S02:  Is that your final decision yep?
P007:  Yeah.
P006:  Final answer.
M001_S02:  [i] ok now the first option is actually the school
P007:  Ok.
M001_S02:  You mentioned adults there but don't forget that adults have families and they have kids.
P007:  They do.
M001_S02:  So #1 [i] s #
P007:  #2 Yeah #
M001_S02:  The school is number one hospital is number two and the airplane is number three. #1 But #
P007:  #2 ok #
M001_S02:  Great, good job, very good.

P007:  Yeah.
P007:  #1 [eh] #
P006:  #2 I don't know # a symphony orchestra. I'm terrible at those. #1 It's just a mini orchestra #
P007:  #2 There was a map of #
P007:  all the things in a symphony ochestra in my school and I'm trying to think of it
P006:  #1 [laugh] #
P007:  #2 now. #
M001_S02:  Well you've already got the #1 two. #
P007:  #2 Yeah. #
P006:  Oh oh there you go. #1 so what do I say? #
M001_S02:  #2 So +[oh] #

P007:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S02:  What with the right or [eh] the ranking #1 in terms of popularity. #
P007:  #2 ok I think violin # would be number one
P006:  #1 Yeah we both came to it first #
P007:  #2 in a big way. #
P006:  to it first.
P007:  Yeah.
P006:  Then it's cellos?
P006:  or drums maybe.
P007:  I don't know I think that was or I don't know the kinda default thing that you think of with the symphony orchestra is like duh duh duh duh duh you know that starts with like #1 the start of #
P006:  #2 [laugh] #
P007:  universal
P006:  Yeah
P007:  movies you know the dun dun dun dun dun.
P006:  #1 oh so the drums? #
P007:  #2 so people might go to drums #
P006:  #1 ok #
P007:  #2 then # second I don't
P006:  #1 [laugh] #
P007:  #2 know it's just a way of thinking of it [laugh] #
P006:  [i] maybe

M001_S02:  #2 mhmm # Ok?
P007:  #1 Yeah #
P006:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S02:  [i] [eh] you were very fast when you had to find the three answers but I'm afraid you again don't have the right ranking.
P007:  [pf]
M001_S02:  It was the violin then the cello.
P006:  [ms] oh
M001_S02:  and the drum #1 was the third #
P007:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S02:  last one but good great work.
