001 M001_S03   Ok hello we are going to play a quiz.

002 P008       hi

003 P009       hello

004 P009       ok

005 M001_S03   I would like to ask you three questions

006 P008       sure

007 M001_S03   which were posed to a group of one hundred people

008 M001_S03   and I would like you to guess the three most popular anwers to these questions

009 P009       umhm

010 M001_S03   and then I will ask you to really have a quick chat about their ranking in terms of popularity.

011 P008       ok

012 M001_S03   So for example if I ask you what is normally used to carry patients in a hospital

013 M001_S03   you would say thin things like ahm

014 M001_S03   wheelchair, a patient's bed for instance ok?

015 M001_S03   Is that clear?

016 P008       yeah

017 P009       umhm

018 M001_S03   ok.

019 M001_S03   So the first question is eh name a public place where you would be more likely to catch ehm a cold or a flu bug.

020 P008       do we take it in turns or

021 M001_S03   You can engage in discussion and when you're ready report back to me and I will give you my hee feedback.

022 P009       ok only one or top three you said

023 P008       ok

024 P008       ehm

025 M001_S03   three

026 P008       top three yeah

027 P009       three yeah

028 P008       ehm probably hospital is

029 P009       yeah I would I would say number one I suppose

030 P008       yeah

031 P008       ehm

032 P008       maybe somewhere like in old folks home?

033 P008       might be like

034 P008       there's a lot of old people there their immune system they're

035 P008       maybe not so as good as it was so might be passing around a little bit

036 P009       hmm ok and

037 P008       or

038 P008       maybe

039 P009       and the third

040 P008       ehm

041 P009       would be an airport

042 P008       I guess

043 P008       yeah actually that would be definitely yeah

044 P009       yeah

045 P009       ok

046 P008       ah maybe don't know maybe school as well?

047 P009       yeah school would be yeah it's I I would skip the old people house and put school in

048 P008       yeah

049 P008       yeah yeah

050 P009       so yeah

051 P008       yeah probably so hospital then airport then

052 P009       school yeah

053 P008       school yeah

054 P009       cool

055 P008       ok

056 M001_S03   Now you have the two ok? You have the school and the hospital, well done

057 P009       umhm

058 M001_S03   and you're very close to the third one

059 M001_S03   which is not the actual airport but it's the means of transport related.

060 P009       ok cool

061 P008       the airplane

062 M001_S03   exactly well done

063 P008       ok

064 M001_S03   so would you like to talk about their ranking now?

065 P008       ehm

066 P009       I would say that the no top would be I'd I would say it's hospital and school would be top

067 P008       yeah I I would probably say hospitan then airplane

068 P008       then school

069 P009       yeah

070 P008       cause I think airplanes are very small little com compactable

071 P009       umhm

072 P009       I think airplane would be on top because there's like atmo you know it's closed atmosphere an you're still ??? in theair so I would say yeah probably airplane would be top

073 P008       yeah

074 P008       number one or number two

075 P009       I would make it number one in my opinion

076 P008       hm

077 P008       I'd say number two but

078 P009       ???

079 P009       ok let's try with that yeah

080 P008       ok

081 P008       so nu

082 M001_S03   so what would be the final

083 P008       number one is hospital

084 M001_S03   decision?

085 P009       yeah

086 M001_S03   hospital

087 P008       and then number two airplane and three school

088 P009       and number two would

089 P009       yeah

090 M001_S03   yeah ok

091 M001_S03   I'm afraid you got the wrong order.

092 P009       oh

093 P008       oh [laugh] 

094 P009       now what

095 M001_S03   so school is the first one the most popular answer, and then it's hospital and the aiplane comes lest last.

096 P009       ah really

097 P008       oh really?

098 P008       ok

099 P009       ok

102 M001_S03   yes but good job

103 M001_S03   are you ready for the second question now?

104 P008       yeah

105 P009       yeah

106 M001_S03   ok

107 P009       sure

108 M001_S03   name an istrument in a symphony orchestra.

110 P008       violin

111 P009       sh eh shello

112 P009       cello or what is

113 P008       cello

114 P009       cello yeah

115 P008       ehm it's three yeah? Three is all.

116 P009       three ah ok the other right

117 M001_S03   umhm

118 P008       yeah

119 M001_S03   you have the two well done [laugh] 

120 P008       ehm

121 P008       ehm

122 P008       third one

123 P008       might be a double bass? Or

124 P009       what's that right on

125 P008       it's like a bigger cello [laugh] 

126 P009       ah probably yeah

127 P008       ehm

128 P009       it m depend on which o are you talking about a european orchestra or

129 P008        [laugh] 

130 P009        [laugh] 

131 M001_S03    [laugh] 

132 P008       ehm

133 P009       or maybe one of the ??? instruments

134 P008       yeah could be I'm not just sym symphony is

135 P009       s s with the sax y n ah

136 P008       is is very particularly means particular kind of orchestra but I'm not sure I think wind instruments are included so maybe flute

137 P009       flute or that saxophone or what do you call that

138 P008       saxophone yeah ehm that would be that would be a brass instrument I think so

139 P009       umhm

140 P008       ehm I think probably violin cello and maybe flute

141 P009       yeah ok yeah

142 P009       that's good that yeah

143 M001_S03   you still have two

144 P008       ok

145 M001_S03   only two

146 M001_S03   so it's the violin and the cello but you're missing one

147 P008       so not not the flute

148 P008       ok

149 P009       eh ah you mean considering that

150 M001_S03   you're issing one more eh it's

151 P008       so not flute flute is incorrect

152 P009       ah ok

153 M001_S03   yeah

154 P009       eh saxophone is not

155 P008       s

156 M001_S03   not really no

157 P008       no ehm

158 P009       what else

159 P008       so might the other can be

160 P008       maybe another string instrument so

161 P009       probably

162 P009       ah piano?

163 P008       could be a vi

164 M001_S03    [ms] not really

165 P008       maybe a viola?

166 P009       ah

167 M001_S03   no these are good ideas but they're not in the list I'm afraid.

168 P008       no or double bass [laugh] 

169 P009       what else is in the usually ok this

170 P008       alright

171 P009       hm what else is in there? is usually

172 P008       ahm well if if there's if there's only strings then the other one is the double bass

173 P008       which I think is probably not

174 M001_S03    [i] not really

175 P008       no

176 M001_S03   think ab about something that is basic in other types of music as well

177 P008       ahm

178 P009       what else is in

179 P008       ahm or maybe

180 M001_S03   in a concert

181 P008       maybe a drum of some sort?

182 P009       I don't think symphony have drums or do they ok

183 M001_S03   hmm

184 P008       yeah

185 P009       yes

186 P008       that would be a drum ok

187 M001_S03   excellent yeah, it's the drum very good, so what would be the ranking?

188 P009       oh wow

189 P009       ah ok

190 P008       I'd say violin is definitely number one

191 P009       the definitely yeah

192 M001_S03   hmm

193 P008       ahm

194 P008       probably then
