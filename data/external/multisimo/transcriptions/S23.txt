P048:  #2 hi #
M003_S23:  very much for coming here today. We are going to play a quiz. So I'm going to ask you three questions that were previously posed to a group of hundred people. You have to find the three most famous [eh] answers to each question. You have to talk to each other you have to collaborate in order to order these [eh] answers then eh in terms of popularity.
P048:  #1 mhmm #
P049:  #2 ok #
M003_S23:  Ready to start?
P048:  #1 mhmm #
M003_S23:  #2 Yeah? #
M003_S23:  So the first question name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or a flu bug.
P049:  [ah] w w who who was asked this like what's the public #1 where was it? #
M003_S23:  #2 It was just # a random sample but I think Maria can give you more #1 information yeah. #
P049:  #2 ok # ok
P048:  So we're just trying to figure out #1 the answers #
M003_S23:  #2 yeah #
P048:  they people might have come up with?
M003_S23:  Yeah.
P048:  #1 [ah] #
P049:  #2 So what's #
M003_S23:  #1 three #
P049:  #2 the question again? #
M003_S23:  [eh] name a place where you're more likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. And you need to #1 get three answers #
P048:  #2 in general #
M003_S23:  #1 yeah. #
P048:  #2 ehm # #1 [ah] #
P049:  #2 It's very broad. #
P048:  [i] I suppose the ob obvious one would be the hospital would it #1 be? #

M003_S23:  #2 [laugh] #
P049:  [laugh] #1 I'd say the beach #
P048:  #2 [ah] #
P049:  but I don't think that makes any sense.
P048:  Beach probably's least likely cause the salt water and that's kind of an antiseptic.
