M001_S04:  ok Hello, thank you for coming today, we're going to play a quiz.
P010:  #1 ok #
M001_S04:  #2 I'd like to ask you # three questions [eh] which were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. And then I would like you to talk to each other about the ranking of these answers in terms of populartiy. Ok? So for example if I ask you what is typically used to carry patients in a hospital you would say things like [ah] you know an ambulance, a wheelchair, a patient's bed or whatever ok?
P011:  hmm
M001_S04:  And then you will have to say which one is the most popular answer to th that question Is it clear what you have to do?
P011:  #1 Yeah. #
M001_S04:  #2 Yeah? #
P010:  mhmm
M001_S04:  So are you ready for the first question?
P011:  Yeah.
P010:  #1 I'm ok #
P011:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S04:  I would lite like you to m name a public place where people [ah]+ m typically get, are likely to get [eh] cold or a flu bug.
P010:  Sorry there
M001_S04:  #1 I would like you to #
P010:  #2 likely to catch #
M001_S04:  think about p public places where you would be mnore likely to get a cold
P010:  #1 oh ok #
M001_S04:  #2 or a f # lu bug
P011:  ok
P011:  ah
M001_S04:  Where would you catch a cold in what public place?
M001_S04:  Or a bug?
P010:  I've heard that airports and airplanes are quite [ah] but for this sort of thing.
M001_S04:  mhmm
M001_S04:  You got the first one, well done. It's actually the airplane one of #1 the answe #
P010:  #2 ok #
M001_S04:  rs so you have two more.
P011:  [ah]
P011:  Like where you can find cold is it?
M001_S04:  [eh] I mean if you think about different public places
P011:  #1 yeah #
M001_S04:  #2 where # would you be more likely to catch the flu or the cold.
M001_S04:  The airplane is one
M001_S04:  then you'll have to find two more answers.
P010:  Do we get hints? Is it always from other people that you get
M001_S04:  Well
P010:  #1 cold #
M001_S04:  #2 you # could think about places that are crowded, you know if you think about places where you would find more people concentrated in the space
M001_S04:  and then
M001_S04:  is easy that it can be contagious within that space.
M001_S04:  So what kind of think about the different age groups for instance.
M001_S04:  Where do different people get sick.
M001_S04:  Ah think about children for instance.
P010:  Yeah I guess
P010:  school or
P011:  yeah
P010:  Yeah that's the other place. Especially like
M001_S04:  hmm
P010:  pre-school
M001_S04:  #1 mhmm mhmm #
P010:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S04:  So the school is another answer. yeah
P011:  [ah]
P011:  May be the ah the hospital? #1 yeah #
M001_S04:  #2 Excellent. #
P011:  #1 [e] #
M001_S04:  #2 You're you got # the third one yeah, very good. So you have the three. Would you like then to have a quick chat about the ranking of these items.
P011:  Eh probably is the first the hospital
P011:  because it's where
P010:  yeah
P011:  ah patients are ah [un] [ah] certain times
P011:  but
P011:  it ah I don't know how to explain like it's eh
P011:  it's supposed to be ah
P011:  not contami not contaminated but in fact it is, because when patients are waiting for doctors they all ah transmitting their sickness to each other I think
P011:  so
P010:  ok
P010:  So, yes I think in the hospital you would have the
P010:  strongest [ah] disease that you could get because I think that from all the drugs they have in there
P011:  yeah
P010:  only the very strong diseases get
P010:  but I think that
P010:  the question was what
P010:  was it what people would say.
P011:  oh
P010:  So I think maybe pe people would think of the school more than the hospital because it's not the question where you actually get
P011:  #1 yeah #
P010:  #2 sick. #
P011:  but like if I had the three answers
P011:  ah
P011:  in face of me and the question
P011:  I would probably choose the hospital like this is where like I would say in order hospital, then school and then airport
P010:  #1 ok #
P011:  #2 airplane #
P010:  #1 yeah I I #
P011:  #2 but your # your idea is great because
P011:  you you're trying to say that this is not where you have sickness, that you can have sickness like pre-school is yeah definitely [laugh] where you get sick easily.
P010:  #1 yeah #
P011:  #2 [laugh] #
P010:  I I I agree that most people would have the airplane last #1 [laugh] #
P011:  #2 yeah # so #1 there you go #
P010:  #2 And then # for the +[eh]
P010:  top two I don't know.
P011:  #1 yeah me neither #
P010:  #2 [laugh] we can # toss a coin
P011:  #1 [laugh] yeah #
P010:  #2 [laugh] # [ah]
M001_S04:  Well you would have to make a final decision now.
P010:  Ok, so how do we make a final decision?
P011:  #1 don't know. #
P010:  #2 We can talk # about it or we can
P011:  #1 [laugh] #
P010:  #2 do # rock, paper, scissors [laugh]
P011:  ok on one time [laugh]
P010:  [ah] So, I
P010:  So I will say school and you get hospital and we do
P011:  #1 If I if I win #
P010:  #2 rock, paper, scissors or? #
P011:  this it's hospital in first and if you win
P010:  #1 it's school first [laugh] #
P011:  #2 school first [laugh] # #1 one time #
M001_S04:  #2 I like your conver # sation skills, I like the way you're trying to reach an agreement
P010:  #1 [laugh] #
M001_S04:  #2 right #
P011:  but because it's all
M001_S04:  #1 hmm #
P011:  #2 it's # also suits me so yeah it's just a good game #1 [laugh] #
P010:  #2 yeah because # #1 both make sense #
M001_S04:  #2 hmm #
P010:  #1 so let's #
M001_S04:  #2 hmm hmm #
P010:  #1 chance #
M001_S04:  #2 hmm #
P010:  #1 decide #
P011:  #2 definitely #
P010:  #1 it's not #
M001_S04:  #2 yeah # yeah
P010:  ok, so do we go one, two, three #1 and go? #
P011:  #2 yeah #
P011:  ok
P010:  ok one #1 two, three #
P011:  #2 two, three #
P010:  go oh
P011:  #1 [laugh] #
P010:  #2 ok anyway you still # win

P011:  #2 hospital first #
P010:  school second.

P011:  #2 understand. #
M001_S04:  people cut.
P011:  ok
P010:  Oh there are so many ways to interpret this
M001_S04:  Let's take it literally.
M001_S04:  What do you normally cut?
M001_S04:  In your everyday life?
P010:  Paper? You had
M001_S04:  #1 very good #
P010:  #2 before #
M001_S04:  #1 yes #
P010:  #2 the scissors # and I had the paper
M001_S04:  #1 exactly #
P010:  #2 [laugh] #
M001_S04:  paper is one thing.
M001_S04:  [laugh]
P011:  This is so weird [laugh] have to think about what you're doing every day.
P011:  [ah]
P011:  #1 ah wood? #
M001_S04:  #2 eh you look like you don't # you don't do a lot of cutting
P011:  #1 ah #
M001_S04:  #2 [laugh] #
P010:  Yeah like it depends also on a person's
M001_S04:  #1 mhmm #
P010:  #2 diet #
M001_S04:  #1 hmm #
P010:  #2 maybe # they cut food but
M001_S04:  Yes, very good thinks about think about different categories of food.
P011:  of [eh]
P011:  cause I I would say wood
M001_S04:  Hm?
P011:  wood
P011:  like when you cut a tree or
M001_S04:  d sorry did you say wood?
P011:  Wood yeah.
M001_S04:  hmm no But if you're talking about food you're very close.
M001_S04:  You don't do a lot of cooking, do you?
P011:  #1 No [laugh] #
M001_S04:  #2 [laugh] #
P010:  We do but that's the thing I think that many people like the vegetables you chop them kind of
M001_S04:  So what else come to
P010:  #1 so #
M001_S04:  #2 what else # comes to your mind?
P010:  Personally I would say that you would cut bread, because I like to get
M001_S04:  #1 don't you normally say we slice #
P010:  #2 like loaf #
P011:  yeah
P010:  but most people anyway get it already sliced #1 so I don't #
M001_S04:  #2 ok #
P010:  think that
M001_S04:  hm
M001_S04:  hm
P010:  people would
M001_S04:  hm
P010:  do that so that's why that's why I mean
P010:  the things that I have in my #1 diet #
M001_S04:  #2 hm #
P010:  and what most people would
M001_S04:  hm
P010:  say
P010:  that's what I #1 find #
M001_S04:  #2 hm #
P010:  difficult to to #1 match. #
M001_S04:  #2 yeah #
M001_S04:  Well, keep guessing.
M001_S04:  What else in terms of food?
P010:  Oh meat.
M001_S04:  Excellent. That's it yes.
P010:  Yeah, I don't eat a lot of that that's why #1 it took me a while [laugh] . #
M001_S04:  #2 ah ok # ok
M001_S04:  And you're missing one more.
P011:  In food also or?
M001_S04:  No
P011:  #1 no? #
M001_S04:  #2 let's # just think about different things now
P011:  ok
M001_S04:  Move away from food.
M001_S04:  I mean this is something you don't cut very frequently very regularly [ah]
M001_S04:  I ma I would think that men usually do that more often than women but it depends again
M001_S04:  on the individual.
P010:  I know that she
P011:  #1 Hair? #
P010:  #2 just # said that
P011:  #1 is it no #
P010:  #2 but we have to think # about something because
P011:  #1 ah no no #

P011:  [eh]
P011:  Hair maybe?
M001_S04:  Excellent well done.

P011:  Paper first.
P010:  Yeah.
M001_S04:  hmm
P011:  Hair second and then meat. I would say #1 this. #
P010:  #2 Very good # very good yes yes, I like that.
