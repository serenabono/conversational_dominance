M001_S11:  #2 Yeah. #
P024:  #1 like long long time #
P025:  #2 [ah] yeah # yeah didn't #1 I wouldn't have #
P024:  #2 gathered yeah #
P025:  thought of that actua
P024:  #1 yeah #
P025:  #2 lly. #
M001_S11:  So you have one more.
P024:  Ok.
M001_S11:  You need to find #1 one more. #
P024:  #2 [oh] #

M001_S11:  #2 Not really #
P024:  No no ok.
P024:  [eh]
P025:  hmm
P024:  So [oh] so it'd be some place like +[eh] some place with a lot of people
M001_S11:  mhmm
P024:  in a +[eh] like cramped space.
M001_S11:  Think about different #1 ages #
P024:  #2 [un] #
M001_S11:  #1 s [eh] #
P024:  #2 [un] #
M001_S11:  #1 [eh] #
P024:  #2 oh ok #
M001_S11:  age groups.
P024:  Oh like [eh] in in th the s school for #1 kids like ki ki #
M001_S11:  #2 Exactly. #
P024:  #1 dergarten #
P025:  #2 Ah yes, schools of course. # #1 hmm #
M001_S11:  #2 Schools. # #1 Ok, so you've got #
P024:  #2 Yeah the the creche # #1 yeah #
P025:  #2 makes sense. #
M001_S11:  #1 exactly. #
P024:  #2 yeah #
M001_S11:  So you have the three, alright? #1 Schools #
P024:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S11:  hospitals airplanes. What would be the ranking?
P024:  [ah]
P024:  It
P024:  doesn't matter who gets sick right? So +[oh]
M001_S11:  You have to think what came f to most people's minds #1 first what was the most popular answer #
P024:  #2 more [oh] ok so so # Oh so is a pop answer ok
M001_S11:  Yeah it doesn't #1 have to do with the probability of you know where would #
P024:  #2 Oh ok yeah oh ok #
M001_S11:  #1 you get #
P025:  #2 mhmm # So it's not actually necessarily the right answer, it's
P024:  yeah
P025:  #1 the most popular yeah #
M001_S11:  #2 Exactly, the most popular the most # common answer that
P025:  #1 hmm #
M001_S11:  #2 most people gave. #
P024:  So I think kindergarten 'd be the lowest because even us we never thought #1 about it. #
P025:  #2 hmm #
P024:  For now it's just either the plane [oh]+ or the [eh]
P024:  or the hospital that's the #1 higher #
P025:  #2 hmm #
P024:  [eh]
P025:  I would say the hospital because well plane I wouldn't have thought of it my #1 self but #
P024:  #2 yeah #
P025:  [eh]
P024:  Yeah so [oh] I think that does that that does [un] agree with our discussion too so it'd #1 be hos #
P025:  #2 hmm #
P024:  pital
M001_S11:  mhmm
P024:  #1 a #
P025:  #2 hm #
P024:  plane and a the the school.
M001_S11:  Do you agree?
P025:  Yes yes
P024:  Yeah.
M001_S11:  I'm sorry you got that #1 wrong it's #
P024:  #2 Oh ok. #
M001_S11:  the school is the first one #1 was the fi #
P024:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S11:  #1 rst answer #
P025:  #2 hmm #
M001_S11:  right? Hospital is number two airplane #1 is number three #
P024:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S11:  you you were right about airplanes.
P024:  Maybe because
M001_S11:  #1 I #
P024:  #2 we didn'r have # have kids #1 [laugh] so we never thought bout it yeah #
P025:  #2 Yeah yeah exactly that's what I thought #
