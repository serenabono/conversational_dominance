M001_S10:  Ok. So I would like us to play a quiz. Ok? I'm going to ask you three questions that were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the most popular answers to these questions. And then I will ask you to talk to each other and decide upon the ranking in terms of popularity. Ok? So +[oh] I might just ask questions like ah what do you usually use to transfer patients you know in a hospital [eh] you wou might say [ii] an ambulance, a patient's eh bed or a wheelchair. Alright? And then I will ask you to tell me which one was the most popular answer so
P022:  Mhmm.
M001_S10:  Ah that's all really. Do you have any questions?
P023:  No #1 that #
P022:  #2 No. #
P023:  #1 seems #
M001_S10:  #2 No? #
P023:  #1 fi #
P022:  #2 yeah #
P023:  ne.
M001_S10:  Ok right.
M001_S10:  So Let's go for the first question now I would like you to name public places where people y wou we you would be more likely to catch [ah] the flu or [eh] a cold.
M001_S10:  So public places where you would catch a cold or a flu bug.
P023:  Ok well ah school
P022:  Yeah.
M001_S10:  Very good #1 you got the #
P022:  #2 ah #
M001_S10:  one yeah [laugh] .
P022:  [ah]
P022:  Oh like are we supposed to collaborate #1 with this #
M001_S10:  #2 Yep # #1 yes. #
P023:  #2 together? # #1 ok #
P022:  #2 ok # [eh] yeah school is [un] one [eh]
P022:  probably like [eh] a nursing home or like #1 what'd you think yeah like carehome? #
P023:  #2 Yeah that's a good one # yeah a hospital #1 as well. #
P022:  #2 Yeah #
M001_S10:  #1 That's the #
P022:  #2 like a yeah #
M001_S10:  second one
P022:  yeah.
M001_S10:  you found the second one yes.
P022:  #1 [eh] #
M001_S10:  #2 So you n # eed to find one more.
P023:  Maybe public transport?
M001_S10:  hmm
P022:  Yeah.
M001_S10:  #1 Can you give #
P022:  #2 ah #
M001_S10:  a specific examples?
P022:  I'd guess a
P023:  #1 bus it ten #
P022:  #2 bus #
P023:  ds to be pretty confined
M001_S10:  Sure, but that was not one of the popular most popular
P023:  #1 Ok. #
M001_S10:  #2 answers. # #1 Yeah. #
P022:  #2 Ok. #
P022:  [ah]
P022:  Is it not like what I've
M001_S10:  #1 It is a means of transport #
P022:  #2 like ot's a public tran #
M001_S10:  ation
P022:  Ok.
M001_S10:  but it's not the bus.
P022:  [ah]
P023:  #1 Guess ah trains #
P022:  #2 Train yeah #
P023:  planes
M001_S10:  That's it [laugh] planes ok #1 so you got the #
P023:  #2 oh ok #
M001_S10:  three now #1 so #
P022:  #2 mhmm #
M001_S10:  [oh] what would you think about their ranking?
M001_S10:  Which one was the most popular answer?
P022:  I'd say hospital #1 or what would #
P023:  #2 It's that people # would associate hospital more with
P023:  the flu.
P022:  Yeah.
P023:  Maybe it's a bias that they would I mean people would be less likely to be in a hospital than to be in school perhaps or to be in
P023:  some forms of public transp #1 ort. #
P022:  #2 Yeah # that's true yeah.
P022:  [ah]
P022:  So +[oh] it's just one two three kind of #1 what we think? #
M001_S10:  #2 Yeah. # Yep. #1 I can give you #
P022:  #2 Oh #
M001_S10:  my feedback at the end.
P022:  ok.
P022:  So what what do you think like if you were to do one two three.
P023:  [ah]+ And we need to think about what one hundred people answered.
M001_S10:  Yes what came first to their mind, to most people's minds.
P023:  Ok.
M001_S10:  Yeah.
P023:  I would guess ho #1 spital #
P022:  #2 Hospital # I would have #1 so hospi #
M001_S10:  #2 mhmm #
P022:  tal first yeah.
P022:  [ah] probably then school cause I wouldn't immediately jump to public transport
P023:  Yeah ha.
P022:  Yeah.
P023:  #1 Ah then #
P022:  #2 But # mine would #1 be that #
P023:  #2 airplanes #
P022:  that that's my first that one anyway it would be +[eh]
P022:  the hospital then the school then the plane but what what do you think?
P023:  Yeah, I'd put the hospital first
P022:  mhmm
P023:  and then
P023:  yeah it seems like a reasonable order to me.
P022:  Ok.
M001_S10:  Is that your final ranking yeah?
M001_S10:  Ok well I'm afraid you got the first two wrong #1 because #
P022:  #2 Really? #
M001_S10:  yeah most people went for the school first and then hospital and the airplane came last. #1 Alright? #
P022:  #2 [oh]+ Ok. # Ok.
M001_S10:  Ok? Good job!
M001_S10:  #1 We're going #
