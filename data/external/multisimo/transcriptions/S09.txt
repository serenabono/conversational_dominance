M001_S09:  So I would like us to pay play a quiz. #1 Right? #
P021:  #2 ok. #
M001_S09:  So I would like to ask you three questions that were posed to a group of one hundred people.
P021:  mhmm
M001_S09:  And I would like you to guess, talk to each other and guess the three most popular answers to these questions. And then I will ask you to decide on the ranking. Ok do you in terms of popularity.
P021:  Ok.
M001_S09:  So for example like if I ask you [eh] name what are the main ways in which you can transfer patients
M001_S09:  in hospital. You would say something like you know a wheelchair, an ambulance, a patient's bed and then I will ask you to talk to each other and decide upon a ranking. #1 O #
P020:  #2 Ok. #
M001_S09:  k?
M001_S09:  Is that clear?
P020:  #1 [eh] Yeah. #

M001_S09:  #1 Alright? +[laugh] #
P021:  #2 ok yeah thanks. #
M001_S09:  So if you're ready for the first question I would like you to name public places where you would be more likely to get [eh] the cold or a flu bug.
P021:  [laugh] #1 Ok. #
P020:  #2 Ok. #
P021:  [e] Right [eh]
P020:  #1 So +[oh] I imagine #
P021:  #2 [eh] I was just thinking # where we're sitting like in a university or something like #1 The univ #
P020:  #2 that. # ersity somewhere where it's always like in colder places as well.
P021:  Yeah.
P020:  But high concentration of pe #1 ople. #
P021:  #2 Exactly. #
P020:  #1 [eh] #

P021:  #2 [laugh] #
P020:  [eh]
P020:  kind of like sports venues.
P021:  I know what you mean we don't have a lot of indoor ski
P020:  #1 Because they have it like in #
P021:  #2 in Ireland but #
P020:  America and #1 in sort of the Middle East #
P021:  #2 Yeah yeah. #
P020:  but #1 I don't know if #
P021:  #2 Yeah. #
P020:  that wouldn't be an answer.
P021:  I can imagine.
P020:  Just because a lot of things could get caught in the snow. #1 Anyway #
P021:  #2 Ye # ah [laugh] .
P020:  I just thought about the concentration of people so.
M001_S09:  Keep guess #1 ing. #
P021:  #2 Well # at school well like maybe doctor's surgeries and hospitals
P020:  Must
P021:  #1 probably. #
P020:  #2 be hospitals. #

P021:  #1 ok. #
M001_S09:  #2 Yes very good # hospit
P021:  #1 And #
M001_S09:  #2 als. #
P020:  So #1 where is #
P021:  #2 Airports # and airplanes really no I always thought air
M001_S09:  #1 Ex #
P021:  #2 ports would #
M001_S09:  cellent.
P020:  #1 Ah. #
P021:  #2 o #

P021:  #2 k. #
M001_S09:  planes
M001_S09:  So you've got the three.
P020:  #1 Great. #
M001_S09:  #2 So I would # like you now to decide about you know about the ranking what #1 were #
P020:  #2 What would the # hundred people say #1 first? #
M001_S09:  #2 Yeah. # #1 Yeah. #
P021:  #2 It's like a game of # family fortunes. ok. #1 [eh] #
P020:  #2 Yeah +[ah] . #
M001_S09:  #1 Which one was #
P021:  #2 What do you think? #
M001_S09:  the most popular answer?
P020:  [ms] #1 I might #
P021:  #2 I'd say # Go on [laugh] .
P020:  #1 I was only #
P021:  #2 [laugh] #
P020:  going to say hospital number one purely because it's like highest concentration #1 of #
P021:  #2 Of really # sick people
P020:  #1 Yeah. #
P021:  #2 maybe yeah # yeah. [i] #1 [eh] #
P020:  #2 But then # schools or hospital #1 s? #
P021:  #2 I'd say # schools just because young children just tends to be lots of runny noses and things #1 around and #
P020:  #2 Less hygie # ne.
P021:  Yeah.
P021:  Teachers are sick a lot. And then maybe airports #1 Airplanes #
