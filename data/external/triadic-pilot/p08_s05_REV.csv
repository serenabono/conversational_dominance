2,00:00:21,2021-06-29 09:30:11,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
3,00:00:49,2021-06-29 09:30:39,Child,I want that one.

8,00:01:12,2021-06-29 09:31:02,Parent,"You ready, [DJ 00:01:15]? Okay. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes, many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meow, meows of cats in the courtyard. And of course, the soft peeping of mice. But music, no. And then one morning... What do you see in that picture? What's the picture, bud?"
9,00:01:46,2021-06-29 09:31:36,Child,[inaudible 00:01:46] door.

12,00:01:47,2021-06-29 09:31:37,Parent,"Oh, daddy went to the store. What do you see in this picture here?"
13,00:01:50,2021-06-29 09:31:40,Child,A door for the mouse.
14,00:01:53,2021-06-29 09:31:43,Parent,"Oh, it's like a door for a mouse. It doesn't look like a store. There's so many things there. But it's called a pantry. And the pantry of the empty house where [crosstalk 00:02:03] Geraldine lived... An elephant?"
15,00:02:07,2021-06-29 09:31:57,Child,Yeah.
16,00:02:07,2021-06-29 09:31:57,Parent,"There's no elephant there. Are we reading the story, buddy?"
17,00:02:10,2021-06-29 09:32:00,Child,No. [inaudible 00:02:10]
18,00:02:10,2021-06-29 09:32:00,Parent,"Can you point to the cheese? Point to the cheese, buddy."
19,00:02:13,2021-06-29 09:32:03,Child,"Um, [inaudible 00:02:13] that."
20,00:02:13,2021-06-29 09:32:03,Parent,"No, that looks like string."
21,00:02:13,2021-06-29 09:32:03,Child,Yeah.
22,00:02:22,2021-06-29 09:32:12,Parent,"That's a big yellow piece. You got it. Good job. Oh, let's go back [inaudible 00:02:28] Yeah. Oh, wait, it tells me about the cheese. I want to read about the cheese. [inaudible 00:02:36] discovered enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly [inaudible 00:02:48] she took a little [inaudible 00:02:51] of it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her hideout in the bar? She ran to her friends who have lived next door and told her about her discovery."
23,00:02:22,2021-06-29 09:32:12,Child,(laughs)
24,00:03:03,2021-06-29 09:32:53,Parent,"(laughs) ""Help me carry it to my hideous,"" she says. ""I'll give you each a big piece."" Her friends [inaudible 00:03:09] happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said. How many mice are there, buddy? Can you count how many mice?"
25,00:03:13,2021-06-29 09:33:03,Child,"One, two, three, four."
26,00:03:17,2021-06-29 09:33:07,Parent,"No, there's more than four. Let's try again. I'll count, I'll point. Ready? Count."
27,00:03:21,2021-06-29 09:33:11,Child,"One, two, three, four, five, six."
28,00:03:27,2021-06-29 09:33:17,Parent,"Six mice. It's enormous! It's gigantic! It's immense! It's fantastic! They shouted with joy when they sh-, saw the cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged, and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout."
29,00:03:47,2021-06-29 09:33:37,Robot,"DJ, what does gigantic mean?"
30,00:03:47,2021-06-29 09:33:37,Parent,Gigantic mean...
31,00:03:54,2021-06-29 09:33:44,Child,[inaudible 00:03:54]
32,00:03:57,2021-06-29 09:33:47,Parent,That's not a gigantic [inaudible 00:03:57] what's another word for gigantic?
33,00:03:59,2021-06-29 09:33:49,Child,[inaudible 00:03:59]
34,00:03:59,2021-06-29 09:33:49,Parent,No. Let's be serious.
35,00:04:04,2021-06-29 09:33:54,Robot,Many mouse friends are helping Geraldine carry the cheese. Would you call the cheese gigantic?
36,00:04:10,2021-06-29 09:34:00,Parent,Would the cheese be gigantic? It is.
37,00:04:14,2021-06-29 09:34:04,Child,[inaudible 00:04:14]
38,00:04:13,2021-06-29 09:34:03,Parent,"Do you, do you know what animal is gigantic? An elephant is gigantic. Do you know what gigantic means?"
39,00:04:21,2021-06-29 09:34:11,Child,"Uh, [inaudible 00:04:25]"
40,00:04:24,2021-06-29 09:34:14,Parent,How about elephants? Are elephants big or small?
41,00:04:29,2021-06-29 09:34:19,Child,Big.
42,00:04:31,2021-06-29 09:34:21,Parent,"Are they really big? Are elephants really big, buddy? Buddy. [crosstalk 00:04:35] Can you answer Jibo's question? Buddy? Sweetie? DJ? Look at mommy here. Jibo wants to know, are elephants really, really big?"
43,00:04:50,2021-06-29 09:34:40,Child,Yeah.
44,00:04:51,2021-06-29 09:34:41,Parent,"Yeah, so we call them gigantic. So can a piece of cheese be gigantic?"
45,00:04:57,2021-06-29 09:34:47,Child,Yeah.
46,00:04:57,2021-06-29 09:34:47,Parent,"Really, really big."
47,00:04:57,2021-06-29 09:34:47,Child,"Really, really, big."
48,00:04:59,2021-06-29 09:34:49,Parent,"Really, really big. That's what it means. Okay. Oh, let's see. Whoa, something's happening. Then Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug in her little teeth and it pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friend carried away their cheese tidbits [crosstalk 00:05:21] Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the [crosstalk 00:05:27] of two enormous [crosstalk 00:05:30] do you see the ears? The cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. Once she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw."
49,00:04:59,2021-06-29 09:34:49,Child,(laughs)
50,00:05:52,2021-06-29 09:35:42,Parent,"What are you seeing, DJ? What are you seeing?"
51,00:05:56,2021-06-29 09:35:46,Child,Mouse [inaudible 00:05:56]
52,00:05:56,2021-06-29 09:35:46,Parent,"A mouse in the cheese? An ear for [inaudible 00:06:00] giant mouse. Tell [crosstalk 00:06:03] solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it had a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the mouse. Then she realized..."
53,00:06:18,2021-06-29 09:36:08,Robot,Do you know what a flute is [crosstalk 00:06:20]
54,00:06:19,2021-06-29 09:36:09,Parent,"Do you know what a flute is, DJ?"
55,00:06:20,2021-06-29 09:36:10,Robot,... and what kind of sound it makes?
56,00:06:21,2021-06-29 09:36:11,Parent,"Do you know what kind of sound a flute makes, DJ?"
57,00:06:24,2021-06-29 09:36:14,Child,[inaudible 00:06:24]
58,00:06:24,2021-06-29 09:36:14,Parent,"You made? [inaudible 00:06:31] a flute? It's a type of musical instrument. You put it up to your mouth and you go, doot, doot, doot, doot, doot. You try."
59,00:06:36,2021-06-29 09:36:26,Child,[inaudible 00:06:36]
60,00:06:36,2021-06-29 09:36:26,Parent,"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Doesn't this [inaudible 00:06:44] flute?"
61,00:06:43,2021-06-29 09:36:33,Robot,"Can you show me how to play the flute, DJ?"
62,00:06:52,2021-06-29 09:36:42,Child,[inaudible 00:06:52]
63,00:06:52,2021-06-29 09:36:42,Parent,"Awesome. Good job. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her flute. Can you play the flute again, DJ?"
64,00:07:25,2021-06-29 09:37:15,Child,[inaudible 00:07:25]
65,00:07:25,2021-06-29 09:37:15,Parent,"Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. Can you play the flute? Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo. [inaudible 00:07:39] ask Jibo a question? Hey, Jibo, can you play the flute?"

75,00:08:14,2021-06-29 09:38:04,Parent,"Did you ever read this book in Mr. [inaudible 00:08:16] class? Let's keep reading. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more... (laughs) [crosstalk 00:08:28] until they seemed to move lightly [inaudible 00:08:30] like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. Music, she thought. This must be music. She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered. Can you tell me the colors you see through the dusty windowpanes. Can you tell me the colors you see over there, DJ? Look at the different colors. What colors are that?"
76,00:08:14,2021-06-29 09:38:04,Child,Red.
