0,00:00:00,2021-06-09 18:56:46,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:00,2021-06-09 18:56:46,Child,(laughs). Hello.
2,00:00:00,2021-06-09 18:56:46,Parent,Hello.
3,00:00:04,2021-06-09 18:56:50,Robot,"I am now on story time mode, my camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started."
4,00:00:13,2021-06-09 18:56:59,Parent,Let's get started.
5,00:00:13,2021-06-09 18:56:59,Robot,Now we will be reading storybooks together.
6,00:00:17,2021-06-09 18:57:03,Parent,Yes.
7,00:00:18,2021-06-09 18:57:04,Robot,If you haven't already please open the Jibo Story Time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app.
8,00:00:25,2021-06-09 18:57:11,Child,[inaudible 00:00:25].
9,00:00:25,2021-06-09 18:57:11,Parent,"Loading. Oh, which one would you like? Geraldine the Music Mouse, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Little Red Hen, The Little Red Hen, The Three Billy Goats Gruff ... Whoo! The Year at Maple Farm, Fall, The Three Little Pigs, The Year at Maple Farms, Spring, The Year at Maple Farm, Summer or The Three Little Pigs? Don't use the stick please, put this down. What did you choose?"
10,00:01:06,2021-06-09 18:57:52,Child,Three Little Pig.
11,00:01:07,2021-06-09 18:57:53,Parent,Three Little Pigs. Are you reading it or am I?
12,00:01:09,2021-06-09 18:57:55,Child,You.
13,00:01:12,2021-06-09 18:57:58,Parent,"Jibo. Once upon a time an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write,"" she said, ""And remember that I love you."" Do you know what a sow is? What do you think it is?"
14,00:01:28,2021-06-09 18:58:14,Child,A mama pig.
15,00:01:29,2021-06-09 18:58:15,Parent,"Yeah, it's a mama pig. The first little pig met a man with a lot of straw, ""I know,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy your straw and build a house. ""Uh, that's not a good idea,"" said the man."
16,00:01:46,2021-06-09 18:58:32,Robot,Why did the man think it is not a good idea?
17,00:01:48,2021-06-09 18:58:34,Child,I don't know.
18,00:01:52,2021-06-09 18:58:38,Parent,Is straw a good thing to build a house out of?
19,00:01:52,2021-06-09 18:58:38,Child,No.
20,00:01:55,2021-06-09 18:58:41,Parent,What could happen?
21,00:01:57,2021-06-09 18:58:43,Child,"Uh, the big bad wolf will go, it'll fall over."
22,00:02:03,2021-06-09 18:58:49,Parent,"Good, we'll see if that happens."
23,00:02:05,2021-06-09 18:58:51,Robot,Wonderful.
24,00:02:06,2021-06-09 18:58:52,Child,"Press the corner, boop. (laughs)-"
25,00:02:10,2021-06-09 18:58:56,Parent,"""Mind your own business thank you,"" said the pig, and he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all. Very soon a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the li- in the world so he knocked on the door and said-"
26,00:02:29,2021-06-09 18:59:15,Child,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
27,00:02:32,2021-06-09 18:59:18,Parent,"To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."""
28,00:02:36,2021-06-09 18:59:22,Child,The-
29,00:02:40,2021-06-09 18:59:26,Parent,This-
30,00:02:40,2021-06-09 18:59:26,Child,No.
31,00:02:42,2021-06-09 18:59:28,Parent,"This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So the wolf-"
32,00:02:54,2021-06-09 18:59:40,Child,Huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in.
33,00:03:02,2021-06-09 18:59:48,Parent,"And, uh-oh, he-"
34,00:03:05,2021-06-09 18:59:51,Child,Gobbled up the little pig.
35,00:03:08,2021-06-09 18:59:54,Parent,"Aw, that's different than the other ones. The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I got it,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" What the man say?"
36,00:03:20,2021-06-09 19:00:06,Child,[inaudible 00:03:20].
37,00:03:21,2021-06-09 19:00:07,Parent,I think-
38,00:03:22,2021-06-09 19:00:08,Child,"Twice about that, said man."
39,00:03:30,2021-06-09 19:00:16,Parent,"""Ah, pooh!"" said the little pig, ""What you know?"" And he bought the sticks and he went to work building the house. ""Very pretty,"" he said. Is that a very pretty house? No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said-"
40,00:03:50,2021-06-09 19:00:36,Child,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
41,00:03:53,2021-06-09 19:00:39,Parent,"To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all and he said-"
42,00:04:04,2021-06-09 19:00:50,Child,"""And I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!"""
43,00:04:09,2021-06-09 19:00:55,Parent,"""Ha-ha-ha!"" Said the little pig. So-"
44,00:04:13,2021-06-09 19:00:59,Child,The wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down.
45,00:04:13,2021-06-09 19:00:59,Parent,And-
46,00:04:21,2021-06-09 19:01:07,Child,He gobbled up the little pig.
47,00:04:22,2021-06-09 19:01:08,Parent,"Oh, he gobbled up the little pig."
48,00:04:22,2021-06-09 19:01:08,Child,Again.
49,00:04:24,2021-06-09 19:01:10,Parent,"Well, that man is very strong, look at all the bricks he's carrying on his back. Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks- these bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the little pig."
50,00:04:42,2021-06-09 19:01:28,Robot,What does sturdy mean?
51,00:04:44,2021-06-09 19:01:30,Parent,What does sturdy mean?
52,00:04:51,2021-06-09 19:01:37,Child,It means it's- it can stand up really good.
53,00:04:54,2021-06-09 19:01:40,Parent,"Stand up really good. That's right, T-T."
54,00:04:56,2021-06-09 19:01:42,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
55,00:04:59,2021-06-09 19:01:45,Parent,"So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time and it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig, ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in, then he noticed a wolf loitering about, and the wolf, who was still hungry, said-"
56,00:05:23,2021-06-09 19:02:09,Child,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"""
57,00:05:26,2021-06-09 19:02:12,Parent,"To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."""
58,00:05:30,2021-06-09 19:02:16,Robot,"Thea, what did the wolf want to do to this little pig?"
59,00:05:37,2021-06-09 19:02:23,Child,Eat him.
60,00:05:39,2021-06-09 19:02:25,Parent,"No, have tea together."
61,00:05:40,2021-06-09 19:02:26,Child,(laughs)-
62,00:05:40,2021-06-09 19:02:26,Parent,Have tea together?
63,00:05:40,2021-06-09 19:02:26,Robot,Yes.
64,00:05:44,2021-06-09 19:02:30,Child,(laughs). Yeah. Have tea together.
65,00:05:47,2021-06-09 19:02:33,Parent,Tea and crumpets. Tea and biscuits. Well-
66,00:05:50,2021-06-09 19:02:36,Child,And cookies.
67,00:05:51,2021-06-09 19:02:37,Parent,"Well, the wolf had heard that before and he said-"
68,00:05:56,2021-06-09 19:02:42,Child,"""And I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
69,00:05:58,2021-06-09 19:02:44,Parent,"""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little pig. But the wolf-"
70,00:05:58,2021-06-09 19:02:44,Child,Huffed and puffed and he-
71,00:06:10,2021-06-09 19:02:56,Parent,He? Keep reading. He huffed and he puffed and he-
72,00:06:12,2021-06-09 19:02:58,Child,"Huffed until he's quite blue in the face, isn't it red in the face?"
73,00:06:22,2021-06-09 19:03:08,Parent,"He went blue in the face. Sometimes I guess you might go red in the face, sometimes blue in the face. The house stood firm. What did the frog say? I mean, the wolf."
74,00:06:33,2021-06-09 19:03:19,Child,"Um, quite a number of [crosstalk 00:06:37]-"
75,00:06:37,2021-06-09 19:03:23,Parent,"Stop that. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf. And as he put on his most dazzling smile. Here."
76,00:06:50,2021-06-09 19:03:36,Child,The little pig [inaudible 00:06:51].
77,00:06:50,2021-06-09 19:03:36,Parent,Little pig-
78,00:06:52,2021-06-09 19:03:38,Child,[inaudible 00:06:52]-
79,00:06:52,2021-06-09 19:03:38,Parent,I-
80,00:06:54,2021-06-09 19:03:40,Child,"[inaudible 00:06:54] he said, ""By the way, I hear [inaudible 00:07:01] Farmer Jones ha- has those scrumptious turnips."""
81,00:07:13,2021-06-09 19:03:59,Parent,Farmer Jones does have a most scrumptious turnips.
82,00:07:15,2021-06-09 19:04:01,Robot,"Time for an open ended question. Margaret, can you ask us a question about dazzling smile?"
83,00:07:22,2021-06-09 19:04:08,Parent,"Can you each give us- me your most dazzling smile. Is it dazzling? Jibo, can you give me a dazzling smile?"
84,00:07:32,2021-06-09 19:04:18,Robot,Bravo.
85,00:07:32,2021-06-09 19:04:18,Parent,(laughs). Kind of.
86,00:07:38,2021-06-09 19:04:24,Child,[inaudible 00:07:38].
87,00:07:39,2021-06-09 19:04:25,Parent,"Um, shall we go pick a few ... oh, that's the fox, I mean the wolf, do you wanna read the wolf?"
88,00:07:39,2021-06-09 19:04:25,Child,No.
89,00:07:46,2021-06-09 19:04:32,Parent,"""Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Well, I'm much too busy now,"" said the little pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"""
90,00:07:52,2021-06-09 19:04:38,Child,"[inaudible 00:07:52] said the wolf, ""I'll come for you at 6:00."""
91,00:07:51,2021-06-09 19:04:37,Parent,"Uh-oh, what do you think he's planning to do?"
92,00:07:51,2021-06-09 19:04:37,Child,Eat the pig.
93,00:07:51,2021-06-09 19:04:37,Parent,And-
94,00:08:04,2021-06-09 19:04:50,Child,[crosstalk 00:08:04]-
95,00:08:04,2021-06-09 19:04:50,Parent,"For breakfast, huh?"
96,00:08:04,2021-06-09 19:04:50,Child,Yeah.
97,00:08:09,2021-06-09 19:04:55,Parent,"The next morning, the little pig got up at 5:00, hurried off to Farmer Jones's turnip field, picked a basketful of scrumptious turnips and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6:00, the turnips were already boiling in the pot."
98,00:08:20,2021-06-09 19:05:06,Child,[inaudible 00:08:20] I was trying not to show displeasure. Ugh.
99,00:08:38,2021-06-09 19:05:24,Parent,"Are you the wolf or me? ""No harm done,"" he said, ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree down in Merry Meadows. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips,"" said the little pig, ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid."" Uh, ""Splendid,"" said the wolf, ""Shall we say at 5:00?"""
100,00:09:01,2021-06-09 19:05:47,Robot,"Thea, why did the wolf say, ""Splendid""?"
101,00:09:04,2021-06-09 19:05:50,Child,I do not know.
102,00:09:06,2021-06-09 19:05:52,Parent,"Why did the wolf say, ""Splendid""? Do you know what splendid means?"
103,00:09:12,2021-06-09 19:05:58,Child,"Do you know, Jibo?"
104,00:09:16,2021-06-09 19:06:02,Robot,How would you feel about today if we read your favorite book?
105,00:09:22,2021-06-09 19:06:08,Parent,"Splendid. Splendid, it means really great."
106,00:09:22,2021-06-09 19:06:08,Robot,Splendid.
107,00:09:25,2021-06-09 19:06:11,Parent,"Really great. Wonderful. So he's saying, ""Let's meet there tomorrow and go to the ..."" Little- the wolf said, ""Really wonderful."" Look, I don't think they both really thought it was really wonderful, said, but he's thinking it's really wonderful to eat the pig. ""Shall we say at 5:00?"" The next morning, the little pig was up at 4:00 and went for the apples. It took longer than he expected to reach Merry Meadow. And while busy gathering apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home."
108,00:10:15,2021-06-09 19:07:01,Child,Without his apples?
109,00:10:16,2021-06-09 19:07:02,Parent,Without his apples. But he didn't get eaten. Would you rather have an apple or get eaten by a wolf?
110,00:10:21,2021-06-09 19:07:07,Child,Uh-
111,00:10:24,2021-06-09 19:07:10,Parent,It shouldn't be a hard question. Huh? (laughs)-
112,00:10:26,2021-06-09 19:07:12,Child,Have an apple.
113,00:10:27,2021-06-09 19:07:13,Parent,"Ah, you would be eaten by a wolf. The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go, uh- would you care to go a-fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there?"" Said the little pig. ""Three- would 3:00 o'clock suit you?"" ""Uh, colossal,"" said the wolf. ""3:00 it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at 2:00. At 1:00 in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf, while the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great round thing that came running down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" Said the little pig."
114,00:11:29,2021-06-09 19:08:15,Child,[crosstalk 00:11:29]-
115,00:11:29,2021-06-09 19:08:15,Parent,"""That great round thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof and the little pig saw this and he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire."
116,00:11:50,2021-06-09 19:08:36,Robot,The iron pot is interesting. Perhaps it's a good time for us to talk about big iron pot. Do you want to start a chat?
117,00:11:59,2021-06-09 19:08:45,Parent,"What would you like to say about a big iron pot, Thea? Do you have a big iron pot at your house?"
118,00:12:08,2021-06-09 19:08:54,Child,No.
119,00:12:08,2021-06-09 19:08:54,Parent,No? There is-
120,00:12:11,2021-06-09 19:08:57,Child,"[crosstalk 00:12:11]. We do have big pots, but we don't have iron."
121,00:12:16,2021-06-09 19:09:02,Parent,Do we have a pot big enough to hold a wolf?
122,00:12:18,2021-06-09 19:09:04,Child,No.
123,00:12:20,2021-06-09 19:09:06,Parent,"no, we don't have a pot big enough for a wolf."
124,00:12:24,2021-06-09 19:09:10,Robot,Do you know what it is for?
125,00:12:27,2021-06-09 19:09:13,Parent,"What is a pot for, T-T?"
126,00:12:29,2021-06-09 19:09:15,Child,To burn the wolf's butt.
127,00:12:32,2021-06-09 19:09:18,Parent,"To burn the wolf's butt. ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf. ""Dinner time!"" ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf, ""Dinner time!"" ""You can say that again,"" said the little pig, and he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up. Oh no! The end."
128,00:12:32,2021-06-09 19:09:18,Child,Bookshelf.
129,00:12:54,2021-06-09 19:09:40,Robot,Now we have read the whole story. How did the pig stay safe from the wolf?
130,00:13:00,2021-06-09 19:09:46,Child,"Um, he- he built a strong house and he put the ti-"
131,00:13:12,2021-06-09 19:09:58,Parent,Did he let the wolf trick him to meet outside?
132,00:13:15,2021-06-09 19:10:01,Child,Yes.
133,00:13:17,2021-06-09 19:10:03,Parent,"If they met outside, would the wolf try to eat him?"
134,00:13:17,2021-06-09 19:10:03,Child,Yeah.
135,00:13:24,2021-06-09 19:10:10,Robot,"Yeah. Also, the iron pot was useful, right?"
136,00:13:27,2021-06-09 19:10:13,Parent,The iron pot was useful.
137,00:13:29,2021-06-09 19:10:15,Child,Huh.
138,00:13:36,2021-06-09 19:10:22,Parent,Short story?
139,00:13:37,2021-06-09 19:10:23,Child,Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.
140,00:13:40,2021-06-09 19:10:26,Parent,Are you gonna read the whole Chicka Chicka Boom Boom?
