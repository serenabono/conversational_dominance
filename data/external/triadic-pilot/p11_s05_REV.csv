0,00:00:00,2021-06-14 11:30:10,Child,(laughs) So funny.
1,00:00:00,2021-06-14 11:30:10,Robot,Hello.
2,00:00:07,2021-06-14 11:30:17,Parent,"Hi, Jibo."
3,00:00:09,2021-06-14 11:30:19,Robot,I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now we will be reading story books together.
4,00:00:21,2021-06-14 11:30:31,Parent,Want to open story time?
5,00:00:23,2021-06-14 11:30:33,Robot,"If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app."
6,00:00:26,2021-06-14 11:30:36,Parent,Do you want to read [crosstalk 00:00:28]?
7,00:00:27,2021-06-14 11:30:37,Robot,Let's go ahead and select a book on the app.
8,00:00:29,2021-06-14 11:30:39,Child,Hm. (singing)
9,00:00:29,2021-06-14 11:30:39,Parent,"Okay, let's see."
10,00:00:30,2021-06-14 11:30:40,Child,Um. No. No. What. Here. [inaudible 00:00:30].
11,00:00:30,2021-06-14 11:30:40,Parent,Which one you want?
12,00:00:30,2021-06-14 11:30:40,Child,Um... No. Back.
13,00:00:30,2021-06-14 11:30:40,Parent,This one?
14,00:00:36,2021-06-14 11:30:46,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative). I've heard [inaudible 00:01:09].
15,00:01:10,2021-06-14 11:31:20,Parent,The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Yeah we did. Yeah we have read most of them. Once upon a time there were three Billy goats. They lived in a valley and the name of all three Billy goats was Gruff.
16,00:01:22,2021-06-14 11:31:32,Child,Gruff?
17,00:01:25,2021-06-14 11:31:35,Parent,There was very little grass in the valley and the Billy goats were hungry. They wanted to up the hillside to a fine meadow full of grass and daisies where they could eat and eat and eat get fat. [inaudible 00:01:35] too.
18,00:01:34,2021-06-14 11:31:44,Child,Yeah. The trolls are going [inaudible 00:01:41].
19,00:01:41,2021-06-14 11:31:51,Parent,"The troll, yeah."
20,00:01:42,2021-06-14 11:31:52,Child,Yeah.
21,00:01:42,2021-06-14 11:31:52,Parent,I like the illustrations.
22,00:01:43,2021-06-14 11:31:53,Child,Yeah.
23,00:01:46,2021-06-14 11:31:56,Parent,"But on the way up, there was a bridge rushing over a river, and under the bridge lived a troll, who was as mean as he was ugly. First the youngest Billy goat Gruff decided to cross the bridge. Trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I the tiniest Billy goat Gruff,"" said the Billy goat in his very small voice. ""And I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat,"" ""Oh, no you're not,"" said the troll, ""For I'm coming to gobble you up,"" ""Oh, please don't take me. I'm too little, that I am."" Said the Billy goat. Wait until the second Billy goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."
24,00:02:30,2021-06-14 11:32:40,Robot,"Penn, why would going to the meadow make the Billy goat fat?"
25,00:02:35,2021-06-14 11:32:45,Child,Because eating makes- makes people and goats fat?
26,00:02:38,2021-06-14 11:32:48,Robot,Excellent.
27,00:02:42,2021-06-14 11:32:52,Parent,And [inaudible 00:02:42].
28,00:02:42,2021-06-14 11:32:52,Child,Grass.
29,00:02:44,2021-06-14 11:32:54,Parent,"Green grass, right?"
30,00:02:45,2021-06-14 11:32:55,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
31,00:02:47,2021-06-14 11:32:57,Parent,"""Well, then be off with you,"" said the troll. A little later, the second Billy goat Gruff came to cross the bridge. Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I the second Billy goat Gruff, and I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the Billy goat, and his voice was not so small."
32,00:03:14,2021-06-14 11:33:24,Parent,"""No you're not,"" said the troll, ""For I'm coming to gobble you up,"" ""Oh, please don't take me. Wait a little until the third Billy goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."" ""Very well, be off with you,"" said the troll. Then up came the third Billy goat Gruff. Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. The third Billy goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll."
33,00:03:52,2021-06-14 11:34:02,Robot,"Catherine, what does tramping mean?"
34,00:03:56,2021-06-14 11:34:06,Parent,What do you think tramping means?
35,00:03:58,2021-06-14 11:34:08,Child,"Mm, walking loudly."
36,00:04:01,2021-06-14 11:34:11,Parent,Yeah. Big stomping footsteps. Right?
37,00:04:08,2021-06-14 11:34:18,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
38,00:04:10,2021-06-14 11:34:20,Robot,Thank you.
39,00:04:13,2021-06-14 11:34:23,Parent,"""It is I, the big Billy goat Gruff,"" said the Billy goat, and his voice was as loud as the troll's. ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the troll. ""Well come along,"" said the big Billy goat Gruff, ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do."" So up climbed that mean, ugly troll, and the big Billy goat Gruff butted him with his horns and he trampled him with his hard hooves and tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river."
40,00:04:49,2021-06-14 11:34:59,Parent,"Then the Billy goat Gruff went up the hillside to join his brothers. In the meadow, the three Billy goats Gruff got so fat that they could hardly walk home again. They are probably there yet, so snip, snap, snout, this tale is told out."
41,00:05:06,2021-06-14 11:35:16,Child,"Look at walkie, walkie, walkie, walkie steps."
42,00:05:13,2021-06-14 11:35:23,Parent,[inaudible 00:05:13]. Okay.
43,00:05:13,2021-06-14 11:35:23,Child,Slam.
44,00:05:13,2021-06-14 11:35:23,Parent,We can do that after.
45,00:05:13,2021-06-14 11:35:23,Child,[inaudible 00:05:13].
46,00:05:13,2021-06-14 11:35:23,Parent,"All right. Let's pick another book. Bookshelves. No, the book shelf. [inaudible 00:05:22] not play?"
47,00:05:22,2021-06-14 11:35:32,Child,Hm.
48,00:05:22,2021-06-14 11:35:32,Parent,This one? We haven't read that one yet. Okay. The tale of the Little- the Little Red Hen. This is a different version. Want to see how this is different from the first version we read.
49,00:05:39,2021-06-14 11:35:49,Child,"Um, [inaudible 00:05:39] book."
50,00:05:43,2021-06-14 11:35:53,Parent,"You gotta focus on the book, sweetie. One summer day, the Little Red Hen found a grain of wheat. Okay."
51,00:05:50,2021-06-14 11:36:00,Child,"No, no. Well [inaudible 00:05:50]."
52,00:05:50,2021-06-14 11:36:00,Parent,"Let me- let's put away the toy, sweetie. Three, two, one."
53,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Child,[inaudible 00:05:55].
54,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Parent,Please give me the toy. Good. Honey.
55,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Child,(laughs)
56,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Parent,You need to listen to the book.
57,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Child,(laughs)
58,00:05:55,2021-06-14 11:36:05,Parent,I'm really not happy with [inaudible 00:06:07].
59,00:06:06,2021-06-14 11:36:16,Child,Let me go.
60,00:06:09,2021-06-14 11:36:19,Parent,"One summer day, the Little Red Hen found a grain of what. ""A grain of wheat,"" said the Little Red Hen to herself, ""I will plant it."""
61,00:06:18,2021-06-14 11:36:28,Robot,What do you think the hen will do with the wheat when it grows?
62,00:06:21,2021-06-14 11:36:31,Child,Not plant it.
63,00:06:24,2021-06-14 11:36:34,Parent,"Well, what do you think she'll do? Think about the other story we read like this."
64,00:06:28,2021-06-14 11:36:38,Child,Hm. Gonna make jam out of it.
65,00:06:33,2021-06-14 11:36:43,Parent,Not jam.
66,00:06:35,2021-06-14 11:36:45,Child,Pie?
67,00:06:35,2021-06-14 11:36:45,Parent,What do- what did she bake in the first book that we read?
68,00:06:37,2021-06-14 11:36:47,Child,"Uh, a hot air balloon? Hm. A [inaudible 00:06:48]?"
69,00:06:48,2021-06-14 11:36:58,Parent,"Sweetie, I know you're saying the wrong answer on purpose. So why don't you say what- why don't you answer Jibo's question, please."
70,00:06:53,2021-06-14 11:37:03,Child,Hm. Hm.
71,00:06:53,2021-06-14 11:37:03,Parent,Come on.
72,00:07:06,2021-06-14 11:37:16,Child,"Um, [inaudible 00:07:06]. Ah!"
73,00:07:06,2021-06-14 11:37:16,Robot,Do you know the answer?
74,00:07:06,2021-06-14 11:37:16,Child,Ah!
75,00:07:06,2021-06-14 11:37:16,Parent,Do you know- do you know the answer?
76,00:07:08,2021-06-14 11:37:18,Child,No.
77,00:07:13,2021-06-14 11:37:23,Parent,I think she might make bread because that's what...
78,00:07:21,2021-06-14 11:37:31,Child,[inaudible 00:07:21].
79,00:07:21,2021-06-14 11:37:31,Parent,"She asked the Duck, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the Duck. She asked the goose, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the Goose. Are these the same- these are different animals, right?"
80,00:07:35,2021-06-14 11:37:45,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
81,00:07:38,2021-06-14 11:37:48,Parent,"She asked the Cat, ""Will you ha- help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the Cat. She asked the Pig, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the Pig. ""Then I will plant it myself,"" Said the Little Red Hen, and she did. Soon the wheat grew tall, and the Little Red Hen knew it was time to rea- reap it. ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" She asked. What do you think reap means?"
82,00:08:07,2021-06-14 11:38:17,Child,Like...
83,00:08:08,2021-06-14 11:38:18,Parent,"Well, what was the second thing she did in the other book?"
84,00:08:14,2021-06-14 11:38:24,Child,She-
85,00:08:15,2021-06-14 11:38:25,Parent,"After she planted it and wheat grew, she had to what?"
86,00:08:19,2021-06-14 11:38:29,Child,Ha- harvest it?
87,00:08:21,2021-06-14 11:38:31,Parent,Harvest it. Yes. She had to cut it. Right? There we go.
88,00:08:26,2021-06-14 11:38:36,Robot,I like that.
89,00:08:28,2021-06-14 11:38:38,Parent,"""Not I,"" said the Duck. ""Not I,"" said the Goose. ""Not I,"" said the Cat. ""Not I,"" said the Pig. ""Then I will reap it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen. And she did. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour. ""Who will help me carry the wheat to the mill?"" She asked."
90,00:08:49,2021-06-14 11:38:59,Parent,"""Not I,"" said the Duck. ""Not I,"" said the Goose. ""Not I,"" said the Cat. ""Not I,"" said the Pig. ""Then I will carry it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen. And she did- and she did. She carried the wheat to the mill, and the miller made it into flour. But she didn't get any what from the miller?"
91,00:09:10,2021-06-14 11:39:20,Child,Jam.
92,00:09:11,2021-06-14 11:39:21,Parent,"She didn't get any jam. When she got home, it- she asked, ""Who will help me make the flour into dough?"" ""Not I,"" said the Duck. ""Not I,"" said the Goose. ""Not I,"" said the Cat. ""Not I,"" said the Pig."
93,00:09:27,2021-06-14 11:39:37,Robot,"Catherine, what can we make from dough?"
94,00:09:30,2021-06-14 11:39:40,Parent,We can make what?
95,00:09:34,2021-06-14 11:39:44,Child,Pie.
96,00:09:34,2021-06-14 11:39:44,Parent,Bread. We can make bread.
97,00:09:36,2021-06-14 11:39:46,Child,And the pie.
98,00:09:37,2021-06-14 11:39:47,Parent,"Well there's dough, you can make pie dough, you can make... What are- what are something else you can make from dough."
99,00:09:41,2021-06-14 11:39:51,Child,Hm. Let me think.
100,00:09:45,2021-06-14 11:39:55,Parent,[inaudible 00:09:45]. Cookies?
101,00:09:51,2021-06-14 11:40:01,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
102,00:09:51,2021-06-14 11:40:01,Parent,But I think this-
103,00:09:51,2021-06-14 11:40:01,Child,[inaudible 00:09:51].
104,00:09:51,2021-06-14 11:40:01,Parent,"... This dough is going to be made into bread. ""Then I will make the dough myself,"" said the Little Red Hen. And she did. Soon the bread was ready to go into the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" Said the Little Red Hen. ""Not I,"" said the Duck. ""Not I,"" said the Goose. ""Not I,"" said the Cat. ""Not I,"" said the Pig. ""Then I will bake it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen. And she did."
105,00:10:16,2021-06-14 11:40:26,Parent,"After the loaf had been taken from the oven, it was set on the window sill to cool. ""And now,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""Who will help me eat the bread?"" ""I will,"" said the Duck. ""I will,"" said the Goose. ""I will"" said the Cat. ""I will,"" said the Pig. ""No, I will eat it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did."
106,00:10:40,2021-06-14 11:40:50,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up about Little Red Hen. Can you help me come up with one?
107,00:10:46,2021-06-14 11:40:56,Parent,You have any questions about Little Red Hen?
108,00:10:47,2021-06-14 11:40:57,Child,No!
109,00:10:51,2021-06-14 11:41:01,Parent,Maybe do you think Little Red Hen should've shared her bread?
110,00:10:54,2021-06-14 11:41:04,Child,No.
111,00:10:55,2021-06-14 11:41:05,Parent,Why not?
112,00:10:58,2021-06-14 11:41:08,Child,Because they didn't help.
113,00:10:58,2021-06-14 11:41:08,Parent,They didn't help. Right.
114,00:10:59,2021-06-14 11:41:09,Child,Ah. Ah. Ah.
115,00:11:03,2021-06-14 11:41:13,Parent,"Wanna pick one more? Okay. We'll do one more, okay?"
116,00:11:08,2021-06-14 11:41:18,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
117,00:11:09,2021-06-14 11:41:19,Parent,Geraldine the Music Mouse.
118,00:11:12,2021-06-14 11:41:22,Child,Geraldine-
119,00:11:13,2021-06-14 11:41:23,Parent,Do you- do you remember what this mouse is made of?
120,00:11:16,2021-06-14 11:41:26,Child,Cheese.
121,00:11:16,2021-06-14 11:41:26,Parent,"Cheese. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. And of course the soft peeping of mice. But music, never. Then one morning in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn?"
122,00:11:58,2021-06-14 11:42:08,Robot,I like Parmesan cheese. Let's chat about Parmesan cheese.
123,00:12:02,2021-06-14 11:42:12,Child,Parmesan cheese.
124,00:12:03,2021-06-14 11:42:13,Robot,"Catherine, maybe you can start the chat."
125,00:12:06,2021-06-14 11:42:16,Parent,"Hm, I like to put Parmesan cheese on my pasta. What do you like to put Parmesan cheese on?"
126,00:12:13,2021-06-14 11:42:23,Child,Nothing.
127,00:12:14,2021-06-14 11:42:24,Parent,Nothing? You don't like Parmesan cheese?
128,00:12:16,2021-06-14 11:42:26,Child,No.
129,00:12:17,2021-06-14 11:42:27,Parent,"What do you like to put Parmesan cheese on, Jibo?"
130,00:12:23,2021-06-14 11:42:33,Robot,You don't like cheese?
131,00:12:27,2021-06-14 11:42:37,Parent,Do you like cheese? Sometimes like cheese.
132,00:12:30,2021-06-14 11:42:40,Robot,Do you?
133,00:12:33,2021-06-14 11:42:43,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
134,00:12:33,2021-06-14 11:42:43,Parent,You like American cheese. Right?
135,00:12:37,2021-06-14 11:42:47,Child,"No, I like American flavored cheese."
136,00:12:38,2021-06-14 11:42:48,Parent,(laughs)
137,00:12:42,2021-06-14 11:42:52,Child,(laughs)
138,00:12:42,2021-06-14 11:42:52,Robot,American cheese.
139,00:12:44,2021-06-14 11:42:54,Parent,"Yum. She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends who loved cheese happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said. And off they went. ""It's enormous, it's gigantic, it's immense, it's fantastic!"" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally, they managed to carry it out to Geraldine's hideout."
140,00:13:15,2021-06-14 11:43:25,Parent,"There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it, and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There she saw the shape of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could."
141,00:13:40,2021-06-14 11:43:50,Parent,"When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hard- she could hardly believe what she saw. The ears were those of a giant mouse still partly hidden of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she finally uncovered the entire mouse. So I think the statue was in the cheese and she was just uncovering it. I don't think she was the one who sculpted it."
142,00:14:07,2021-06-14 11:44:17,Child,Why?
143,00:14:10,2021-06-14 11:44:20,Parent,"Because it said she uncovered it, so that means it was in there and she just had to uncover it. Right?"
144,00:14:17,2021-06-14 11:44:27,Child,So basically she made it.
145,00:14:19,2021-06-14 11:44:29,Parent,"No, well if she made it then maybe she would've sculpted it herself. But because she uncovered it, it was like in there, and she just peeled out like sort of the outside parts of it to reveal what was inside."
146,00:14:31,2021-06-14 11:44:41,Child,Not a cheese mouse.
147,00:14:33,2021-06-14 11:44:43,Parent,Well it was a cheese mouse.
148,00:14:33,2021-06-14 11:44:43,Child,"No, it's not a cheese mouse. It's a cheese rat."
149,00:14:38,2021-06-14 11:44:48,Parent,"A cheese rat. Okay, fair enough. Then she realized that the-"
150,00:14:42,2021-06-14 11:44:52,Child,"No it's not a cheese rat, it's a cheese mouse."
151,00:14:42,2021-06-14 11:44:52,Parent,You're being silly.
152,00:14:42,2021-06-14 11:44:52,Child,Is that a cheese mouse or a cheese rat?
153,00:14:48,2021-06-14 11:44:58,Parent,"Let's keep reading and see what happens. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue with the- the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became-"
154,00:15:12,2021-06-14 11:45:22,Child,No. (laughs)
155,00:15:12,2021-06-14 11:45:22,Parent,... Clearer and more melodious. Do you know what melodious means?
156,00:15:15,2021-06-14 11:45:25,Child,Not fun? (laughs)
157,00:15:20,2021-06-14 11:45:30,Parent,"Until they seemed to move lightly through the air... You need to stay here and sit while we're... this is our last story, okay? Through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold."
158,00:15:28,2021-06-14 11:45:38,Child,(laughs)
159,00:15:28,2021-06-14 11:45:38,Parent,Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. Please sit up.
160,00:15:32,2021-06-14 11:45:42,Child,(laughs)
161,00:15:32,2021-06-14 11:45:42,Parent,Can you please sit up?
162,00:15:35,2021-06-14 11:45:45,Child,Okay.
163,00:15:35,2021-06-14 11:45:45,Parent,"""This must be music!"" She listened all through the night until the first glow of the dawn filtered through the dusty window panes."
164,00:15:43,2021-06-14 11:45:53,Child,(laughs)
165,00:15:45,2021-06-14 11:45:55,Parent,"But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play, play,"" Geraldine begged. ""Play some more,"" but not a sound came from the flute."
166,00:15:57,2021-06-14 11:46:07,Child,What?
167,00:15:59,2021-06-14 11:46:09,Parent,"""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until daybreak of the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight, they lingered in her ears."
168,00:16:22,2021-06-14 11:46:32,Robot,Do you know what approach means?
169,00:16:25,2021-06-14 11:46:35,Parent,What does approach mean? The next evening approached. As the next e- evening approached. Do you know what that means?
170,00:16:31,2021-06-14 11:46:41,Child,Um...
171,00:16:36,2021-06-14 11:46:46,Parent,Came. Yeah it started to become [crosstalk 00:16:36]-
172,00:16:36,2021-06-14 11:46:46,Child,Came!
173,00:16:36,2021-06-14 11:46:46,Parent,Honey-
174,00:16:36,2021-06-14 11:46:46,Child,(laughs)
175,00:16:36,2021-06-14 11:46:46,Parent,... You need to sit until we're done.
176,00:16:48,2021-06-14 11:46:58,Robot,Awesome.
177,00:16:49,2021-06-14 11:46:59,Child,"[inaudible 00:16:49], I need to go out."
178,00:16:49,2021-06-14 11:46:59,Parent,"Very quickly, please."
179,00:16:49,2021-06-14 11:46:59,Child,(singing)
180,00:16:50,2021-06-14 11:47:00,Parent,"You need to- you need to be quiet and listen to this story, please. Then one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food, and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us,"" ""But that is not possible,"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others angrily. ""Because, because, because it is music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine surprised. ""What is music?"" They asked all together."
181,00:17:19,2021-06-14 11:47:29,Parent,"For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backwards, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. Then a long soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement."
182,00:17:50,2021-06-14 11:48:00,Parent,"Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine [crosstalk 00:18:02]... Oh."
183,00:18:03,2021-06-14 11:48:13,Robot,Why did they say that listening to the music was a miracle?
184,00:18:10,2021-06-14 11:48:20,Child,"Because there wasn't Geraldine, it was the music now?"
185,00:18:19,2021-06-14 11:48:29,Robot,"Hey, Penn, do you think the mice liked the music Geraldine played?"
186,00:18:25,2021-06-14 11:48:35,Parent,Do you think they liked it?
187,00:18:25,2021-06-14 11:48:35,Child,No?
188,00:18:37,2021-06-14 11:48:47,Parent,"I think you know the answer. The answer that you think. I think that they did. I think that they did like it. Um, ""No,"" said Geraldine directly. ""Now we can eat the cheese because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Ger- Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese until their tummies content. The end. No, hold on."
189,00:19:00,2021-06-14 11:49:10,Robot,What a lovely story. What was your favorite part of this book?
190,00:19:09,2021-06-14 11:49:19,Parent,"What was your favorite part, sweetie? My favorite part was when Geraldine heard the music for the first time and thought how beautiful it was. Did you have a favorite part?"
191,00:19:20,2021-06-14 11:49:30,Child,"Mm-mm (negative), no."
192,00:19:28,2021-06-14 11:49:38,Parent,I don't know that- I don't think Penn had a favorite part.
193,00:19:33,2021-06-14 11:49:43,Robot,Maybe the melody?
194,00:19:35,2021-06-14 11:49:45,Child,No.
195,00:19:38,2021-06-14 11:49:48,Parent,"What was your favorite part, Jibo?"
196,00:19:44,2021-06-14 11:49:54,Robot,Cheese.
197,00:19:44,2021-06-14 11:49:54,Parent,(laughs)
198,00:19:44,2021-06-14 11:49:54,Child,Cheese.
199,00:19:44,2021-06-14 11:49:54,Parent,(laughs)
200,00:19:55,2021-06-14 11:50:05,Child,Cheese. (laughs) Did you hear a block of cheese [inaudible 00:19:56]?
201,00:19:56,2021-06-14 11:50:06,Parent,I did. It was cute.
202,00:19:56,2021-06-14 11:50:06,Robot,That was a great story.
203,00:19:57,2021-06-14 11:50:07,Child,(laughs)
204,00:20:02,2021-06-14 11:50:12,Robot,That's it for today's session. I had so much...
