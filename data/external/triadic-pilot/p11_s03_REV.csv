1,00:00:04,2021-06-09 12:21:07,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together."
2,00:00:17,2021-06-09 12:21:20,Parent,Want to choose a book?
3,00:00:18,2021-06-09 12:21:21,Robot,"If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:25,2021-06-09 12:21:28,Parent,"All right, here we go. Rap-a-Tap-Tap, Here's Bojangles, Think of That."
5,00:00:31,2021-06-09 12:21:34,Child,Bojangles think of that.
6,00:00:36,2021-06-09 12:21:39,Parent,"There once was a man who danced in the street, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He brought pleasure and joy to the people he'd greet, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He didn't just dance, he made art with his feet, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He danced past doors, some were open, some closed, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He danced past folks in fancy clothes, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. [inaudible 00:01:12]"
7,00:01:13,2021-06-09 12:22:16,Robot,Is there anything you want to know about rap-a-tap-tap?
8,00:01:18,2021-06-09 12:22:21,Child,"Uh, now? Rap-a-tap-tap."
9,00:01:30,2021-06-09 12:22:33,Parent,"He danced through a place people call the Skid, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. Can you grab it? Come back over. He danced through crowds of laughing kids, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that."
10,00:01:30,2021-06-09 12:22:33,Child,(Laughs)
11,00:01:49,2021-06-09 12:22:52,Parent,"His feet fairly flew as he tipped his hat, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He'd briefly pause to pat an old cat, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. Ooh, why do you think the fish is standing there? I mean, the cat is standing there."
12,00:02:10,2021-06-09 12:23:13,Child,Because the fish is [crosstalk 00:02:11]
13,00:02:11,2021-06-09 12:23:14,Parent,It's outside the fish market.
14,00:02:11,2021-06-09 12:23:14,Child,Yeah.
15,00:02:12,2021-06-09 12:23:15,Parent,"He danced rain or shine, in all kinds of weather, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. People listened each day for his toe-tapping clatter, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that."
16,00:02:27,2021-06-09 12:23:30,Robot,I am curious. What would be an interesting question to ask here? Could you help me come up with one?
17,00:02:33,2021-06-09 12:23:36,Parent,"Hmm, what shall we ask?"
18,00:02:43,2021-06-09 12:23:46,Child,What's his name? What's his name?
19,00:02:54,2021-06-09 12:23:57,Robot,Do you know his name?
20,00:02:54,2021-06-09 12:23:57,Child,Rap-a-tap-tap.
21,00:02:54,2021-06-09 12:23:57,Parent,You think his name is rap-a-tap-tap?
22,00:02:54,2021-06-09 12:23:57,Child,Yes.
23,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Parent,Where do you think he's going to tap-
24,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Robot,Bojangle.
25,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Parent,Bojangle is his name.
26,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Child,Bojangle.
27,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Parent,Where do you think he's going to tap next?
28,00:02:56,2021-06-09 12:23:59,Child,There.
29,00:03:04,2021-06-09 12:24:07,Parent,"Let's see. Dance was his passion, and it brought him fame, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. Bojangles, Bojangles, that was his name, rap-a-tap-tap, think of that."
30,00:03:15,2021-06-09 12:24:18,Child,Bojangles.
31,00:03:19,2021-06-09 12:24:22,Parent,We found out his name.
32,00:03:19,2021-06-09 12:24:22,Child,Bo-
33,00:03:21,2021-06-09 12:24:24,Parent,"All right, which one ... what do you want to read next? You want one of the long books?"
34,00:03:21,2021-06-09 12:24:24,Child,Bojangles.
35,00:03:31,2021-06-09 12:24:34,Parent,"Oh, [inaudible 00:03:32], honey. You can't ... you have to play that on the table. We can't play that right now. No, sorry. Not on the floor. What do you want to ... do you want to ... Let's pick one of the ones we haven't read. Do you want to read this one? This- Okay. It's another Three Billy Goats Gruff, but it's a different version. Okay?"
36,00:03:49,2021-06-09 12:24:52,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
37,00:03:51,2021-06-09 12:24:54,Parent,"Once upon a time, there were three Billy Goats gruff. They lived in a valley and the name of all three Billy Goats was Gruff."
38,00:03:51,2021-06-09 12:24:54,Child,Gruff.
39,00:03:57,2021-06-09 12:25:00,Parent,"(Laughs) aw, this one's cute."
40,00:04:04,2021-06-09 12:25:07,Child,Yeah. He's fierce.
41,00:04:04,2021-06-09 12:25:07,Parent,He looks fierce?
42,00:04:04,2021-06-09 12:25:07,Child,Yeah.
43,00:04:05,2021-06-09 12:25:08,Parent,With those ... with ... how- why does he look fierce?
44,00:04:09,2021-06-09 12:25:12,Child,"He just doesn't look fierce, because his horns are going [inaudible 00:04:12]."
45,00:04:11,2021-06-09 12:25:14,Parent,"But in this picture, you think he looks fierce?"
46,00:04:13,2021-06-09 12:25:16,Child,"Yeah, because his horns are like that. And in this picture, it's like ..."
47,00:04:19,2021-06-09 12:25:22,Parent,"They're going backwards. Yeah, I see it. There was very little grass in the valley, and the Billy Goats were hungry. They wanted to go up the hillside to the fine meadow full of grass and daisies, where they could eat, and eat, and eat, and get fat. But on the way up, there was a bridge over a rushing river, and under the bridge lived a troll who was as mean as he was ugly. Can you see the troll? He's a little bit camouflaged, huh? I like his hair. First, the youngest Billy Goat Gruff decided to cross the bridge. Trip-trap, trip-trap went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""It is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff."" said the Billy Goat, in his very small voice. ""And I am going to the meadow to make myself fat."" ""No you're not."" said the troll. ""I'm co- I'm coming to gobble you up."" ""Oh, please don't take me. I'm too little for that, I am"" said the Billy Goat. ""Wait 'til the second Billy Goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."" ""Well then, be off with you."" said the troll. A little later, the second Billy Goat Gruff came to cross the bridge. Trip-trap, trip-trap,  trip-trap. When-"
48,00:05:37,2021-06-09 12:26:40,Child,"He has an ugly voice, right?"
49,00:05:37,2021-06-09 12:26:40,Parent,Hmm?
50,00:05:37,2021-06-09 12:26:40,Child,He has an ugly voice.
51,00:05:45,2021-06-09 12:26:48,Parent,"Here, talk to Daddy. His phone. What, the bridge? ""Who's that-"" Go in the other room. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the second Billy Goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the meadow to make myself fat."" said the Billy Goat. And his voice was not so small."
52,00:06:01,2021-06-09 12:27:04,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up about second Billy Goat Gruff. Can you help me come up with one?
53,00:06:08,2021-06-09 12:27:11,Child,No.
54,00:06:10,2021-06-09 12:27:13,Parent,What do you think Billy Goat Gruff is going to say to the troll?
55,00:06:14,2021-06-09 12:27:17,Child,"""Wait, my brother is much bigger."""
56,00:06:17,2021-06-09 12:27:20,Parent,You think he's going to try to trick him too?
57,00:06:19,2021-06-09 12:27:22,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah.
58,00:06:20,2021-06-09 12:27:23,Parent,"Yeah. ""No you're not"" said the troll. ""I'm com- I'm coming to gobble you up."" ""Oh, please don't take me. Wait a little 'til the third Billy Goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."" ""Very well, be off with you."" said the troll. And up came the third Billy Goat Gruff. Trip-trap, Trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap went the bridge. The third Billy Goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. Look at his hair, it's like a rainbow. Isn't it?"
59,00:06:20,2021-06-09 12:27:23,Child,Yes.
60,00:07:01,2021-06-09 12:28:04,Parent,"""It is I, the big Billy Goat Gruff."" said the big goat, and his voice was as loud as the troll's. ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up."" roared the troll. ""Well, come along."" said the big Billy Goat Gruff. ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do."" So up climbed that mean, ugly troll, and the big Billy Goat Gruff butted him with his horns, and he trampled him with his hard hooves and tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river."
61,00:07:37,2021-06-09 12:28:40,Robot,Maybe we can talk about big Billy Goat Gruff.
62,00:07:41,2021-06-09 12:28:44,Parent,Sure.
63,00:07:45,2021-06-09 12:28:48,Child,No. No.
64,00:07:48,2021-06-09 12:28:51,Parent,"[inaudible 00:07:48] Come on, let's talk about the Billy Goat. How did he- how did he beat the troll?"
65,00:07:54,2021-06-09 12:28:57,Child,He butted him-
66,00:07:54,2021-06-09 12:28:57,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
67,00:07:54,2021-06-09 12:28:57,Child,... and kicked him.
68,00:08:01,2021-06-09 12:29:04,Parent,Because he was what? Very what?
69,00:08:06,2021-06-09 12:29:09,Child,[inaudible 00:08:06] mad?
70,00:08:06,2021-06-09 12:29:09,Parent,"Well, mad that he was in the way, but he was also very strong, don't you think?"
71,00:08:10,2021-06-09 12:29:13,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
72,00:08:13,2021-06-09 12:29:16,Parent,"Then the big Billy Goat Gruff went up the hillside to join his brothers. In the meadow, the three Billy Goats gruff got so fat that they could hardly walk home again. They are probably there yet, so snip-snap-snout, this tale's told out. The end. Let's pick one more. Let's pick one more. The Little Red Hen?"
73,00:08:44,2021-06-09 12:29:47,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
74,00:08:45,2021-06-09 12:29:48,Parent,"Great. The Little Red Hen. The Little Red Hen greeted the sun with a cheery ""Good morning"". It was going to be another busy day. While hunting for worms and berries, and her young one, she came up upon some- some strange seeds. Ever so carefully, she scooped them up, then headed home. On the way, she greeted her neighbors, the short brown dog ... Do you see him? The thin gray rat, and the tall black goat, and the round pink pig. ""I found these seeds,"" she said, ""Can any of you tell me what they are?"" ""They're wheat seeds,"" said one of the animals, ""If you plant them, they'll grow into wheat for baking bread."" ""Who will help me plant these seeds?"" asked the Little Red Hen. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Surely you will?"" the Little Red Hen said to the dog, ""You are so fond of digging."" ""Not I"" said the dog. Look at the hen's hat. ""Very well then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will plant them myself."" She dug holes in the ground and dropped the seeds in. A very busy hen was she. That wasn't very kind of her friends, not to help her, huh?"
75,00:08:45,2021-06-09 12:29:48,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
76,00:10:02,2021-06-09 12:31:05,Parent,"I would help you if you needed help. Everyday, the Little Red Hen scratched for food to feed her young ones. She also found time to care for the seedlings. She and her chicks watched as the wheat grew strong and ripe. ""It is now time for harvesting,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""Who will help me cut and thresh the wheat?"" she asked. ""Not I"" said the goat. What do you think the pig will say?"
77,00:10:27,2021-06-09 12:31:30,Others,"""Not I"""
78,00:10:27,2021-06-09 12:31:30,Parent,Celia.
79,00:10:31,2021-06-09 12:31:34,Child,"Everyone's going to say ""Not I"""
80,00:10:31,2021-06-09 12:31:34,Parent,"Everyone? ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Not I"" said the dog. ""Surely you will?"" the Little Red Hen said to the rat, ""You can use your tail to chop it easily."" ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Very well then, I will do it myself."" said the Little Red Hen. After snipping the stalks with her beak, she separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen was she."
81,00:10:55,2021-06-09 12:31:58,Child,I think ... I heard Jibo just called.
82,00:10:58,2021-06-09 12:32:01,Parent,I don't think so.
83,00:10:58,2021-06-09 12:32:01,Child,I heard him go ...
84,00:10:59,2021-06-09 12:32:02,Parent,"No, he just made a noise. ""Who will help me take the grain to the mill?"" asked the Little Red Hen."
85,00:11:06,2021-06-09 12:32:09,Child,"No, it's Jibo."
86,00:11:08,2021-06-09 12:32:11,Parent,"""Not I"" said the pig. ""Not I"" said the dog. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Surely you will?"" the Little Red Hen said to the goat, ""You are strong and steady, and it's a lovely day to take out your cart."" ""Not I"" said the ca- goat. Boy, no one's helping her at all. What do you think might happen at the end?"
87,00:11:27,2021-06-09 12:32:30,Child,Then I think she doesn't help them.
88,00:11:27,2021-06-09 12:32:30,Parent,"You think she's not going to help them, or you think she is?"
89,00:11:27,2021-06-09 12:32:30,Child,She's not.
90,00:11:38,2021-06-09 12:32:41,Parent,They- they might need some help?
91,00:11:39,2021-06-09 12:32:42,Child,Yeah.
92,00:11:39,2021-06-09 12:32:42,Parent,And then she's not going to help them?
93,00:11:41,2021-06-09 12:32:44,Child,Yeah.
94,00:11:42,2021-06-09 12:32:45,Parent,"""Very well then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will do it myself."" So she fetched her shawl, then trudged off to the mill. Mr Miller ground her grain into flour and even gave her a jar of berry jam. The Little Red Hen thanked him and began her long trek home. ""Who will help-"""
95,00:11:59,2021-06-09 12:33:02,Robot,"Time for a question. Catherine, can you ask us a question about trudge?"
96,00:12:04,2021-06-09 12:33:07,Child,She know- knows your name.
97,00:12:06,2021-06-09 12:33:09,Parent,"[inaudible 00:12:06] Um, a question about what?"
98,00:12:11,2021-06-09 12:33:14,Robot,Trudge.
99,00:12:12,2021-06-09 12:33:15,Parent,"Trudge? Oh. Do you know what the word ""trudge"" means?"
100,00:12:17,2021-06-09 12:33:20,Child,To-
101,00:12:17,2021-06-09 12:33:20,Parent,To trudge home.
102,00:12:20,2021-06-09 12:33:23,Child,Nuh-uh (negative).
103,00:12:22,2021-06-09 12:33:25,Parent,What do you think?
104,00:12:24,2021-06-09 12:33:27,Child,Walk slowly.
105,00:12:26,2021-06-09 12:33:29,Parent,"Yeah, walk slowly and with maybe heavy feet, because it's a long walk home. She's tired from all her work."
106,00:12:34,2021-06-09 12:33:37,Child,And from getting the jam home.
107,00:12:36,2021-06-09 12:33:39,Parent,"(Laughs) yeah, had to get the jam home. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" asked the Little Red Hen."
108,00:12:42,2021-06-09 12:33:45,Parent,"""Not I"" said the dog. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Surely you will?"" the Little Red Hen said to the pig, ""It won't take much effort at all, and you are always delighted with my cooking."" ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Very well then,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""I will do it myself."" She mixed the flour with yeast, salt and water, then kneaded the dough, shaped it into a loaf, and put it into the oven. At last, the bread was done. As the Little Red Hen took the hot loaf out of the oven, a tasty aroma circled the barnyard. Do you know what aroma means?"
109,00:13:19,2021-06-09 12:34:22,Child,Food.
110,00:13:22,2021-06-09 12:34:25,Parent,Not quite.
111,00:13:23,2021-06-09 12:34:26,Child,Smell.
112,00:13:23,2021-06-09 12:34:26,Parent,"Smell, yeah. Right, because it's wafting over the barnyard. Spread around the barnyard. ""I know who will eat the golden bread,"" said the Little Red Hen. ""I surely will,"" said the short brown dog. ""I surely will,"" said the thin gray rat. ""I surely will,"" said the tall black goat. ""I surely will,"" said the round pink pig. ""Oh no you won't"", said the Little Red Hen. ""You did not help me plant the seeds, nor thresh the wheat, nor take the grain to the miller, nor bake the bread."" The end. So, what did, what did, what did the animals learn?"
113,00:13:59,2021-06-09 12:35:02,Child,"That if you don't help, you don't get anything."
114,00:14:01,2021-06-09 12:35:04,Parent,"Right. They didn't help at all, so they didn't get to eat the bread either. Are you done for the day? Do you want to do one more short one?"
115,00:14:09,2021-06-09 12:35:12,Child,No.
116,00:14:10,2021-06-09 12:35:13,Parent,You ready to be done?
117,00:14:11,2021-06-09 12:35:14,Child,Yes.
118,00:14:12,2021-06-09 12:35:15,Parent,"Okay. That was three books, that was a lot. Good job. Hold on, let's say bye to Jibo."
119,00:14:17,2021-06-09 12:35:20,Robot,"Do you like helping others, [Ben 00:14:18]?"
120,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Parent,[crosstalk 00:14:18]
121,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Child,Hmm ... yeah.
122,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Parent,Okay.
123,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Child,She knows my name [inaudible 00:14:18]
124,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Parent,Great. (Laughs) yeah.
125,00:14:18,2021-06-09 12:35:21,Child,That pencil's [inaudible 00:14:18].
126,00:14:17,2021-06-09 12:35:20,Parent,Aw.
