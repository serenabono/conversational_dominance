2,00:00:06,2021-05-11 08:04:32,Child,Hi.
3,00:00:07,2021-05-11 08:04:33,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select the book on the app."
4,00:00:28,2021-05-11 08:04:54,Parent,Which one do you want? The long story?
5,00:00:29,2021-05-11 08:04:55,Child,Yeah.
6,00:00:31,2021-05-11 08:04:57,Parent,Okay.
7,00:00:31,2021-05-11 08:04:57,Child,Let's see if [inaudible 00:00:32].
8,00:00:31,2021-05-11 08:04:57,Parent,"I think they are the same ones, because they're premeditated-loaded or something."
9,00:00:40,2021-05-11 08:05:06,Child,[inaudible 00:00:40].
10,00:00:40,2021-05-11 08:05:06,3rd person,[inaudible 00:00:40].
11,00:00:43,2021-05-11 08:05:09,Child,[inaudible 00:00:43].
12,00:00:46,2021-05-11 08:05:12,Parent,[inaudible 00:00:46].
13,00:00:47,2021-05-11 08:05:13,Child,[inaudible 00:00:47].
14,00:00:51,2021-05-11 08:05:17,Parent,"It's not a movie. [inaudible 00:00:51]. Okay. Ready. The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Once upon a time there were three billy goats. They lived in a valley and the name of the furry Billy goats was, Gruff."
15,00:01:04,2021-05-11 08:05:30,Child,[crosstalk 00:01:04].
16,00:01:04,2021-05-11 08:05:30,Parent,"Okay. Hold on. [inaudible 00:01:13]. All right. There was very little grass in the valley and the billy goats were hungry. They wanted to go up the hillside to a fine meadow full of grass and daisies where they can eat, and eat, and eat, and eat, and get fat and full. Yep."
17,00:01:28,2021-05-11 08:05:54,Child,Yeah.
18,00:01:29,2021-05-11 08:05:55,Parent,But on the way there was a bridge over rushing river and under the bridge as a troll who was as mean as he was ugly.
19,00:01:39,2021-05-11 08:06:05,Child,He is.
20,00:01:41,2021-05-11 08:06:07,Parent,"First day youngest Billy Goat Gruff decided to cross this bridge. Trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. ""Who is that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the tiniest Billy Goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat in his very small voice, ""and I am going to the meadow to make myself fat,"" ""no, you're not,"" said the troll, ""for I'm coming to gobble you up,"" ""oh, please don't take me. I am little. I am too little, that I am,"" said the billy goat."" Wait until the second Billy Goat Gruff comes, he is much bigger. ""Well, then be off with you,"" said the troll. Why is that light being annoying?"
21,00:02:28,2021-05-11 08:06:54,Parent,"[inaudible 00:02:28]. A moment later, the second Billy Goat Gruff came to cross the bridge. Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. ""Who is that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the second Bill Goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the billy goat, who's voice was not so small. ""No, you're not,"" said the troll, ""for I'm coming to gobble you up,"" ""oh, please don't take me, I am little,"" until the third Billy Goat Gruff comes, he is much bigger. ""Very well, be off with you,"" said the troll."
22,00:03:07,2021-05-11 08:07:33,Parent,"Then up came the third Billy Goat Gruff. Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. The third Billy Goat Gruff... I'm so sorry, computer, but Isaac get down. Get down. The dog."
23,00:03:25,2021-05-11 08:07:51,Child,He's scared.
24,00:03:25,2021-05-11 08:07:51,Parent,"The third Billy Goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll, oh, his teeth are yellow."
25,00:03:37,2021-05-11 08:08:03,Child,Yeah.
26,00:03:39,2021-05-11 08:08:05,Parent,"""It is I, the big Billy Goat Gruff,"" said the Billy goat, and his voice was as loud as the trolls. ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the troll, ""well, come along,"" said the Billy Goat Gruff. ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do."" So up climbed that mean, ugly troll and the big Billy Goat Gruff butted him with his horns and he trampled him with his hard hooves, and he tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river. A catfish came out to say, ""What is going on?"" And the big Billy Goat Gruff went up the hillside to join his brothers. Ah, the troll's drowning. [inaudible 00:04:28] didn't we?"
27,00:04:33,2021-05-11 08:08:59,Parent,"In the meadow the three Billy Goat Gruffs got so fat that they could hardly walk home. They're probably there yet. So snip, snap, snap, this tale's [inaudible 00:04:43]."
28,00:04:45,2021-05-11 08:09:11,Child,Now I want-
29,00:04:45,2021-05-11 08:09:11,Parent,Because they're going to sleep On the hill with their full bellies watching the [inaudible 00:04:50].
30,00:04:52,2021-05-11 08:09:18,Child,[inaudible 00:04:52].
31,00:04:52,2021-05-11 08:09:18,Parent,"Oh, wait, there was [crosstalk 00:04:57]."
32,00:04:57,2021-05-11 08:09:23,Robot,That was a great story. Want to read another one?
33,00:04:59,2021-05-11 08:09:25,Child,Yeah. [crosstalk 00:04:59].
34,00:04:59,2021-05-11 08:09:25,Parent,"[crosstalk 00:04:59] same story. We're going to read something else. Look, there are ones about fall, spring, summer. Do you want to read about spring?"
35,00:05:11,2021-05-11 08:09:37,Child,No. I want to read the second Billy Goat Gruff.
36,00:05:12,2021-05-11 08:09:38,Parent,"Honey, it's the exact same story."
37,00:05:13,2021-05-11 08:09:39,Child,But I just want to [inaudible 00:05:17].
38,00:05:18,2021-05-11 08:09:44,Parent,"Do you [inaudible 00:05:18]. All right. The Three Billy Goat Gruffs, again. [inaudible 00:05:27]. Once upon a time, there was three Billy Goats Gruff. There was a little Billy Goat Gruff, a middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff, and a big Billy Goat Gruff. The three Billy Goats Gruff lived in a field where they spent their days munching the green grass. On one side of the field there was a stream, and over the stream there was rickety bridge. On the other side of the rickety bridge there was a hill, and there the grass grew greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the Billy Goats Gruff. It looks the same though. 00:06:06]."
39,00:06:06,2021-05-11 08:10:32,Parent,"Under the rickety bridge lived a big, hairy troll in a deep, dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge and that made the troll furious, he was also hungry. One day the little Billy Goat Gruff looked up and saw that the grass up the hill on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll go over there for my next course,"" he said, ""now I'll grow big and fat, so trip, trap, trip, trip,"" said the little Billy gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. The big, hairy troll woke up with a start, ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" He roared. ""I am,"" said the little Billy Goat Gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream,"" ""oh, no, you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goats a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."""
40,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Parent,"""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little Billy Goat Gruff. I'm only small. I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much bigger. He skipped over the [inaudible 00:07:25]. That troll looks really big. Just then the middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff looked up, and he too saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said, ""then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap-"
41,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Child,He looks funny.
42,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Parent,"I'm sorry. Went the hooves of the middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who is that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am,"" said the middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the gras on the other side of the stream,"" ""oh, no you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a..."""

45,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Child,Dinner.
46,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Parent,"Dinner. ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the middle-sized Billy Goat Gruff. I'm not very..."" what? He's not what?"
47,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Child,Not very big.
48,00:07:25,2021-05-11 08:11:51,Parent,"He's not very big. ""I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much, much bigger,"" and skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then the Billy Goat Gruff looked up and he too saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very, very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said, ""then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip, trap, trip trap, here goes the big Billy Goat Gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big, hairy troll, ""I am,"" said the big Billy Goat Gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream,"" ""oh, no, you're not,"" said the big hairy troll.

52,00:09:32,2021-05-11 08:13:58,Parent,"What? The big Billy Goat Gruff stopped. His knees shook. His hooves trembled. Clickity-clack, clickity-clack on the rickety bridge. Then he pulled himself together. ""I don't think you will,"" he said. And he kicked up his hooves and he kicked the troll into the middle of next week. Then the big Billy Goat Gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big, hairy troll, I and happy to say that he was never seen again."
53,00:10:08,2021-05-11 08:14:34,Child,Now let's read these.
54,00:10:08,2021-05-11 08:14:34,Parent,"You want to read one of those other ones that we haven't read before? Maybe summer, fall, or spring?"
55,00:10:20,2021-05-11 08:14:46,Child,[inaudible 00:10:20].
56,00:10:22,2021-05-11 08:14:48,Parent,You read that one.
57,00:10:23,2021-05-11 08:14:49,Child,No. [inaudible 00:10:23].
58,00:10:23,2021-05-11 08:14:49,Parent,"All right. I'll see. Thank you though, we're done with that story. Should we read another?"
59,00:10:30,2021-05-11 08:14:56,Child,[inaudible 00:10:30] to wait?
60,00:10:30,2021-05-11 08:14:56,Parent,You can say it again.
61,00:10:33,2021-05-11 08:14:59,Child,"Hey, Jibo, should we read another story?"
62,00:10:49,2021-05-11 08:15:15,Robot,I love this story. Do you want to read another one?
63,00:10:54,2021-05-11 08:15:20,Parent,Yeah. Please. [crosstalk 00:10:55].
64,00:10:57,2021-05-11 08:15:23,Child,[crosstalk 00:10:57].
65,00:11:00,2021-05-11 08:15:26,Parent,[inaudible 00:11:00]. Okay. Thanks.
66,00:11:14,2021-05-11 08:15:40,Child,It's beyond [inaudible 00:11:14] better than reading. It's the movie [crosstalk 00:11:14].
67,00:11:14,2021-05-11 08:15:40,Parent,"We got Three Little Pigs. It's not a movie and it's called book. It's just on the computer. [inaudible 00:11:20] visual [inaudible 00:11:22]. All right. Sit down. Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day Mother Pig said, ""You are all grown up now. It's time for you to go out into the world and build your own house. Build them strong and you will be safe from the big, bad wolf."" The first little pig was lazy little pig. He built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong."
68,00:11:57,2021-05-11 08:16:23,Parent,The second little pig was a playful little pig and he built his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong.
69,00:12:08,2021-05-11 08:16:34,Parent,"And the third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to his mother's advice and built a strong house from bricks. The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big, bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry and for supper he wanted a pig. The big, bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared, ""not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" replied the pig. The pig [inaudible 00:12:46]. ""Then I will huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in,"" growled the wolf. So the wolf puffed and he puffed and he blew the straw house down. And the first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him."
70,00:13:34,2021-05-11 08:18:00,Parent,"Next the wolf knocked on the second little pigs door, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared, ""not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew that stick house down. And the second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him."
71,00:13:41,2021-05-11 08:18:07,Parent,"The third little pig heard a knock on his door and he was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side of the door. Do you know what trembling means? Shaking, because they were so scared."
72,00:13:52,2021-05-11 08:18:18,Child,Shaking what?
73,00:13:53,2021-05-11 08:18:19,Parent,"Trembling, they were shaking."
74,00:13:56,2021-05-11 08:18:22,Child,Shaking [inaudible 00:13:57].
75,00:13:57,2021-05-11 08:18:23,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). ""The big, bad wolf blew our houses down,"" they cried, ""quick com inside,"" said the brother. Minutes later there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" ""not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" What happened then?"
76,00:14:29,2021-05-11 08:18:55,Child,It stayed up.
77,00:14:32,2021-05-11 08:18:58,Parent,"So wolf puffed, and he puffed, and then he puffed and huffed. And no matter how hard he tried he could not blow the brick house down. Why/"
78,00:14:40,2021-05-11 08:19:06,Child,Because it was so strong.
79,00:14:42,2021-05-11 08:19:08,Parent,"Because it was strong, like his mommy told him. He's a good listener."
80,00:14:47,2021-05-11 08:19:13,Child,Yep.
81,00:14:47,2021-05-11 08:19:13,Parent,"The big, bad wolf was very angry."
82,00:14:50,2021-05-11 08:19:16,Child,Because it's [crosstalk 00:14:50].
83,00:14:50,2021-05-11 08:19:16,Parent,"""I'll get you, little piggies,"" he snarled. He climbed up on the roof and he crept toward the chimney, uh-oh."
84,00:15:00,2021-05-11 08:19:26,Child,[crosstalk 00:15:00]
85,00:15:00,2021-05-11 08:19:26,Parent,"Hearing the wolf up on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. You're right? [crosstalk 00:15:07] chimney and was met with hot, [inaudible 00:15:11] flames. [crosstalk 00:15:14]."
86,00:15:16,2021-05-11 08:19:42,Child,Yeah.
87,00:15:16,2021-05-11 08:19:42,Parent,"His tail's smokey. The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling and the big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again, and they lived happily ever after. [crosstalk 00:15:34]. It's okay."
88,00:15:38,2021-05-11 08:20:04,Child,[crosstalk 00:15:38].
89,00:15:38,2021-05-11 08:20:04,Parent,Now they all live together in the one house.
90,00:15:40,2021-05-11 08:20:06,Child,"Yep. In the one, strong brick house."
91,00:15:43,2021-05-11 08:20:09,Parent,Maybe they'll go out. What do you think they'll go out and do next? Do you think they'll all live together? What could the other pigs do?
92,00:15:51,2021-05-11 08:20:17,Child,[crosstalk 00:15:51] they should be smart too.
93,00:15:59,2021-05-11 08:20:25,Parent,"[crosstalk 00:15:59]. They were smart in their ideas, but it wasn't wise. It wasn't necessarily smart to build such weak house [crosstalk 00:16:08]."
94,00:16:07,2021-05-11 08:20:33,Child,Yep. [crosstalk 00:16:08].
95,00:16:08,2021-05-11 08:20:34,Parent,[crosstalk 00:16:08].
96,00:16:08,2021-05-11 08:20:34,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
