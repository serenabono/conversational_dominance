3,00:00:46,2021-06-24 18:32:52,Child,"Oh, which one? Short stories. Is this short?"
4,00:01:16,2021-06-24 18:33:22,Parent,Yeah. On the farm.
5,00:01:24,2021-06-24 18:33:30,Child,"We did this already, but-"

12,00:02:00,2021-06-24 18:34:06,Parent,"That's true. We could do that. Hit that, hit the, hit the page please. The pony whinnies in the wind, kicks in his stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, not, just not as tall."
13,00:02:17,2021-06-24 18:34:23,Child,Big.
14,00:02:19,2021-06-24 18:34:25,Robot,"Hey Alex, why do you think he kicks his stall?"
15,00:02:24,2021-06-24 18:34:30,Child,"To, to get out of his stall. [inaudible 00:02:30]."
16,00:02:24,2021-06-24 18:34:30,Parent,That's a good reason.
17,00:02:24,2021-06-24 18:34:30,Child,Why is this guy-
18,00:02:39,2021-06-24 18:34:45,Parent,What's he doing there?

21,00:02:46,2021-06-24 18:34:52,Child,"Yeah, he's kicking the stall."
22,00:02:46,2021-06-24 18:34:52,Parent,"Alright. You want to go to the next page? The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shady farmhouse yard. You might think he's keeping cool, beware he's keeping guard. How do you know he's keeping guard?"
23,00:03:11,2021-06-24 18:35:17,Child,"Because, because one, one eye is open and one eye is closed and [inaudible 00:03:17]."
24,00:03:22,2021-06-24 18:35:28,Parent,That's a good answer. So I picked [inaudible 00:03:24].

28,00:03:34,2021-06-24 18:35:40,Parent,"Um, you could try it. I don't know if Jibo's doing that lately."
29,00:03:42,2021-06-24 18:35:48,Child,"It was last time. Hey Jibo, Jibo."
30,00:03:52,2021-06-24 18:35:58,Robot,Yes.
31,00:03:53,2021-06-24 18:35:59,Child,"Why did the ... What, why do you think that the dog is keeping watch?"
32,00:04:03,2021-06-24 18:36:09,Robot,"Um, can you ask it again?"
33,00:04:11,2021-06-24 18:36:17,Child,Why is the dog keeping watch?
34,00:04:20,2021-06-24 18:36:26,Robot,Guarding.
35,00:04:23,2021-06-24 18:36:29,Parent,"That's true, that's what he's doing. He's keeping watch to guard. [inaudible 00:04:31], good question dear. The sheep began his wooly life as gentle as a lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram, bam."

40,00:04:48,2021-06-24 18:36:54,Child,Chow. Do not like each other.
41,00:04:55,2021-06-24 18:37:01,Parent,"(laughs) I guess that's possible. They might, they might be deciding who is the biggest ram of them all or something."
42,00:05:06,2021-06-24 18:37:12,Child,Don't tell that-
43,00:05:06,2021-06-24 18:37:12,Parent,You go ahead and hit that.

162,00:13:01,2021-06-24 18:45:07,Child,Ice cream.
163,00:13:01,2021-06-24 18:45:07,Robot,Haha.
164,00:13:04,2021-06-24 18:45:10,Child,"Hey Jibo, it actually is true. Excuse me [inaudible 00:13:07]."
165,00:13:07,2021-06-24 18:45:13,Parent,[inaudible 00:13:07].
166,00:13:06,2021-06-24 18:45:12,Child,"By the way, I like ice cream, in case you forgot. I know I'm only five or so, but I don't care."
167,00:13:26,2021-06-24 18:45:32,Parent,I can touch. I touch with my fingers.
168,00:13:28,2021-06-24 18:45:34,Child,It kind of looks like he lost a finger.
169,00:13:28,2021-06-24 18:45:34,Parent,(laughs).
170,00:13:29,2021-06-24 18:45:35,Child,That looks like he lost his-
171,00:13:32,2021-06-24 18:45:38,Parent,I don't think so.
172,00:13:32,2021-06-24 18:45:38,Child,His fingertips. It kind of looks like it though.
173,00:13:39,2021-06-24 18:45:45,Parent,I do all of this with my senses. I have five senses. When I see the sun or a frog.
174,00:13:47,2021-06-24 18:45:53,Robot,"Alex, what do you use your senses for?"
175,00:13:47,2021-06-24 18:45:53,Child,"Doing things like touch, hear, lick."
176,00:13:47,2021-06-24 18:45:53,Robot,Eating ice cream?
177,00:13:52,2021-06-24 18:45:58,Child,Yes. Eating ice cream is lick.
178,00:14:14,2021-06-24 18:46:20,Parent,Can you see?
179,00:14:15,2021-06-24 18:46:21,Child,Yes. I can see you and you and that thingy and that thingy and that thingy and that thingy.
180,00:14:15,2021-06-24 18:46:21,Parent,Are we all thingies? I don't think so.
181,00:14:34,2021-06-24 18:46:40,Child,"(laughs). Yes, we are. [inaudible 00:14:34]."
182,00:14:33,2021-06-24 18:46:39,Parent,For my baby sister I use my sense of sight. I am seeing.
183,00:14:39,2021-06-24 18:46:45,Child,"Hello baby. Hello B. Hello baby [inaudible 00:14:43]. I'm calling him, I'm calling him neon."
184,00:14:53,2021-06-24 18:46:59,Parent,Why are you calling her neon?
185,00:14:53,2021-06-24 18:46:59,Child,"Because that, because I want, because, because I think neon is the name."
186,00:14:53,2021-06-24 18:46:59,Parent,Okay.
187,00:14:53,2021-06-24 18:46:59,Child,This.
188,00:15:00,2021-06-24 18:47:06,Parent,"When I hear a drum or a fire engine or a bird, I use my sense of hearing. I am hearing."
189,00:15:07,2021-06-24 18:47:13,Child,"I thought this would be really short, but it's not."
190,00:15:11,2021-06-24 18:47:17,Parent,"When I smell soap or a pine tree or cookies just out of the oven, I use my sense of smell. I am smelling."
191,00:15:20,2021-06-24 18:47:26,Child,"[inaudible 00:15:20], those, those look good."
192,00:15:21,2021-06-24 18:47:27,Robot,"Which smells better to you, cookies or a pine tree?"
193,00:15:24,2021-06-24 18:47:30,Child,"Uh, Charlie's cookies."
194,00:15:32,2021-06-24 18:47:38,Robot,"Haha, I'd also like cookies."
195,00:15:38,2021-06-24 18:47:44,Child,"Uh, Jibo-"
196,00:15:39,2021-06-24 18:47:45,Robot,Maybe popcorn as well.
197,00:15:42,2021-06-24 18:47:48,Child,"Did you, did you realize you can't eat? So you don't know what-"
198,00:15:50,2021-06-24 18:47:56,Robot,Sorry?
199,00:15:51,2021-06-24 18:47:57,Child,You can't eat.
200,00:15:53,2021-06-24 18:47:59,Parent,"Jibo, can you eat?"
201,00:16:04,2021-06-24 18:48:10,Robot,"Um, I can eat data."
202,00:16:04,2021-06-24 18:48:10,Parent,(laughs).
203,00:16:04,2021-06-24 18:48:10,Child,(laughs).
204,00:16:04,2021-06-24 18:48:10,Robot,Alright.
205,00:16:05,2021-06-24 18:48:11,Child,Data about popcorn?
206,00:16:13,2021-06-24 18:48:19,Parent,"(laughs) Maybe [inaudible 00:16:14], maybe data about popcorn, yeah. When I drink my milk and eat my food, I use my tense, sense of taste. I am tasting. Chomp."
207,00:16:31,2021-06-24 18:48:37,Child,Chop.
208,00:16:32,2021-06-24 18:48:38,Parent,You're not chomping right.
209,00:16:32,2021-06-24 18:48:38,Child,I'm the chomper.
210,00:16:33,2021-06-24 18:48:39,Parent,"When I touch a kitten or a balloon or water, I use my sense of touch. I am touching. Sometimes I use all of my senses at once, sometimes I use only one. I often play a game with myself and guess how many senses I am using at that time. When I look at the moon and the stars, I use one sense, I am seeing. When I laugh and play with my puppy, I use four senses. I see, hear, smell and touch."
211,00:17:21,2021-06-24 18:49:27,Child,I think that's five.
212,00:17:22,2021-06-24 18:49:28,Parent,"No, that was four. When I bounce a ball, I use three senses. I see, hear and touch."
213,00:17:28,2021-06-24 18:49:34,Child,"Yeah that, yeah, that one I know is three senses."
214,00:17:32,2021-06-24 18:49:38,Parent,"Sometimes I use more of one sense and less of another, but each sense is very important to me because it makes me aware. To be aware is to see all that there is to see, hear all there is to hear, smell all there is to smell, taste all there is to taste and touch all there is to touch. What do you see?"
215,00:17:32,2021-06-24 18:49:38,Child,You still think that's five senses?
216,00:18:09,2021-06-24 18:50:15,Robot,"Alex, why is touch important?"
217,00:18:12,2021-06-24 18:50:18,Child,"To, to get, to know that you can eat so you can eat food to, to grow up [inaudible 00:18:23] and maybe even pick some flowers."
218,00:18:25,2021-06-24 18:50:31,Parent,Those are good things. You would need sense of touch for all of those.
219,00:18:35,2021-06-24 18:50:41,Child,"By the way, I said the, the flower pick [inaudible 00:18:42] mommy [inaudible 00:18:45] me picking flowers for mom."
220,00:18:35,2021-06-24 18:50:41,Parent,"Aw, well that's very nice."
221,00:18:35,2021-06-24 18:50:41,Child,"Uh, I think she lost the flower."
222,00:18:35,2021-06-24 18:50:41,Parent,(laughs) Oh my goodness. Are you on a trumpet?
223,00:18:56,2021-06-24 18:51:02,Robot,"Yeah, great."
224,00:19:01,2021-06-24 18:51:07,Parent,"Wherever I go, whatever I do, every minute of the day my senses are working, they make me aware."
225,00:19:06,2021-06-24 18:51:12,Child,He is touching a lot of things.
226,00:19:10,2021-06-24 18:51:16,Parent,"The end. Okay, push end."
227,00:19:18,2021-06-24 18:51:24,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up about being aware. Can you help me come up with one?
228,00:19:30,2021-06-24 18:51:36,Parent,What do you think about being aware?
229,00:19:41,2021-06-24 18:51:47,Child,"Uh-uh, I don't even know what it means."
230,00:19:45,2021-06-24 18:51:51,Parent,"Um, it means to use your senses to understand something."
231,00:19:54,2021-06-24 18:52:00,Child,"So how, so how does [inaudible 00:19:57]?"
232,00:19:56,2021-06-24 18:52:02,Parent,"So you might say, I, I might say, ""Are you aware that it's too ... Are you aware about how warm it is in here?"""
233,00:20:07,2021-06-24 18:52:13,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
234,00:20:08,2021-06-24 18:52:14,Parent,Is-
235,00:20:08,2021-06-24 18:52:14,Child,"It's, it's, it's a room temperature that [inaudible 00:20:12] the cold and the hot."
236,00:20:12,2021-06-24 18:52:18,Parent,That is exactly correct. And you're aware of that temperature. Good job.
237,00:20:23,2021-06-24 18:52:29,Child,"Between the, between, between the, the, the [inaudible 00:20:28] and the, and the leg leg."
238,00:20:31,2021-06-24 18:52:37,Parent,"Yes, that's true. You [inaudible 00:20:34] the part above the, above the line on the thermometer in the [inaudible 00:20:40] the temperature [inaudible 00:20:42]. Okay. Alright, well pick one more."
239,00:20:49,2021-06-24 18:52:55,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
240,00:20:55,2021-06-24 18:53:01,Child,Yeah.
241,00:20:55,2021-06-24 18:53:01,Parent,Good.
242,00:20:56,2021-06-24 18:53:02,Child,I just picked the bugs one for [inaudible 00:21:00].
243,00:20:59,2021-06-24 18:53:05,Robot,"I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey with your child together."
244,00:21:13,2021-06-24 18:53:19,Child,Again?
245,00:21:13,2021-06-24 18:53:19,Robot,Thank you. Bye-bye.
246,00:21:13,2021-06-24 18:53:19,Child,We got to do it again?
247,00:21:14,2021-06-24 18:53:20,Parent,Bye Jibo. Was this supposed to be the last time?
248,00:21:14,2021-06-24 18:53:20,Child,"Yeah. Yeah but, yeah but I still don't like it."
249,00:21:27,2021-06-24 18:53:33,Parent,"Alright. It won't take that long, will-"
