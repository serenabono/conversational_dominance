1,00:00:00,2021-05-04 18:08:18,Child,He's dancing. (laughs)
2,00:00:00,2021-05-04 18:08:18,Robot,"Hello. I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. I may behave a little differently in story time mode. I will not be responding to, ""Hey Jibo"" and I will not turn blue, but we can still chat. Because today is our first session, I would first like to learn how you guys read books without me. Today, I will just be listening here."
3,00:00:35,2021-05-04 18:08:53,Robot,"Let's get started. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Story Time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:45,2021-05-04 18:09:03,Parent,"Okay, it's loading. Now it says, do you want a short story or a long story?"
5,00:00:49,2021-05-04 18:09:07,Child,Long story.
6,00:01:00,2021-05-04 18:09:18,Parent,"Long story. Loading. Okay, there's these options."
7,00:01:01,2021-05-04 18:09:19,Child,I wanna do-
8,00:01:03,2021-05-04 18:09:21,Parent,There's other options.
9,00:01:05,2021-05-04 18:09:23,Child,... the goats.
10,00:01:06,2021-05-04 18:09:24,Parent,"The goats, the Three Billy Goats Gruff?"
11,00:01:16,2021-05-04 18:09:34,Child,Yeah. Yeah.
12,00:01:16,2021-05-04 18:09:34,Parent,All right. Ready?
13,00:01:16,2021-05-04 18:09:34,Child,Yep.
14,00:01:17,2021-05-04 18:09:35,Parent,(laughs) All right. The Three Billy Goats Gruff. I'm assuming I just touch it. Oh. Do I slide it?
15,00:01:29,2021-05-04 18:09:47,Child,"No, slide it from the front?"
16,00:01:31,2021-05-04 18:09:49,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
17,00:01:32,2021-05-04 18:09:50,Robot,You can flip the page by touching the bottom of the page.
18,00:01:37,2021-05-04 18:09:55,Parent,"Thank you. (laughs) Okay. So once upon a time there were three Billy goats gruff. There was a little Billy goat gruff, a middle-sized Billy goat gruff and a big Billy goat gruff. The three Billy goats gruff lived in a field and they spent their days munching the green grass. On one side of the field there was a stream, and on the other, and ... I'm sorry, and over the stream there was a rickety bridge. I don't think we've read this one yet."
19,00:02:06,2021-05-04 18:10:24,Parent,"On the other side of the rickety bridge there was a hill, and the grass grew greener and greener, or greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the Billy goats gruff. Under the rickety bridge lived a big hairy troll in a deep dark hole."
20,00:02:22,2021-05-04 18:10:40,Child,Where's the troll?
21,00:02:25,2021-05-04 18:10:43,Parent,"I think that's it, look."
22,00:02:29,2021-05-04 18:10:47,Child,"I know, but what's that part?"
23,00:02:31,2021-05-04 18:10:49,Parent,What part is that? I don't know. That looks like what?
24,00:02:32,2021-05-04 18:10:50,Child,The hands.
25,00:02:32,2021-05-04 18:10:50,Parent,Hands? Or?
26,00:02:32,2021-05-04 18:10:50,Child,The hands.
27,00:02:36,2021-05-04 18:10:54,Parent,"I think that's the feet. And maybe that's its nose and its eye. Is it? All right, so it says wa- it was damp and cold, and under ... cold under the bridge, and that made the troll furious. He was also hungry. One day, the little Billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass upon the hill ... I'm sorry, up the hill on the other side ... Don't touch it."
28,00:03:03,2021-05-04 18:11:21,Child,I want a hug.
29,00:03:04,2021-05-04 18:11:22,Parent,"On the st- (laughs) [inaudible 00:03:05] Um, let me start over. Don't touch it 'cause I don't want to-"
30,00:03:11,2021-05-04 18:11:29,Child,[inaudible 00:03:11]
31,00:03:12,2021-05-04 18:11:30,Parent,"One day, the little Billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass up the hill on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said. ""Then I'll grow big and fat."" So trip trop, trip trop, went the hooves of the little Billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. The big hair troll woke up with a start."
32,00:03:40,2021-05-04 18:11:58,Child,Oh.
33,00:03:42,2021-05-04 18:12:00,Parent,"Oh. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" He roared. ""I am."" Said the little Billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not!"" Said the big hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat, and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" That looks pretty scary."
34,00:04:09,2021-05-04 18:12:27,Child,No it doesn't.
35,00:04:10,2021-05-04 18:12:28,Parent,"You don't think so? ""Oh, don't do that."" Said the little Billy goat gruff. ""I'm only small, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the middle-sized Billy goat gruff looked up, and he saw tw- and he too, saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet."
36,00:04:33,2021-05-04 18:12:51,Parent,"""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" Trip trop, trip trop, moved the hooves of the little ... I mean, of the Billy ... (laughs) I can't, why can't I read? Of the middle-sized Billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge."
37,00:04:53,2021-05-04 18:13:11,Parent,"""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big hairy troll. ""I am."" Said the middle-sized Billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not!"" Said the big hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner and I need to eat. A goat's a ..."""
38,00:05:15,2021-05-04 18:13:33,Child,Good treat.
39,00:05:16,2021-05-04 18:13:34,Parent,"A treat, yeah. ""A treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" [inaudible 00:05:22] ""Oh, don't do that."" Said the middle-sized Billy goat gruff. ""I'm not very big, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much, much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side."
40,00:05:37,2021-05-04 18:13:55,Parent,"Just then, the big Billy goat gruff looked up, and he too, saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip trip, trip trop, moved the hooves of the Billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge."
41,00:05:59,2021-05-04 18:14:17,Parent,"This is the last goat, right? ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big hairy troll. ""I am."" Said the big Billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not!"" Said the big hairy troll."
42,00:06:15,2021-05-04 18:14:33,Child,Troll.
43,00:06:15,2021-05-04 18:14:33,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). ""I'm a t- troll from a deep dark hole. My belly is getting ..."" Do you remember the word?"
44,00:06:26,2021-05-04 18:14:44,Child,Fat.
45,00:06:26,2021-05-04 18:14:44,Parent,Thinner.
46,00:06:26,2021-05-04 18:14:44,Child,Thinner?
47,00:06:29,2021-05-04 18:14:47,Parent,"Right. [inaudible 00:06:29] ""I need to eat and a goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" The big Billy goat gruff stopped. His knees shook, his hooves trembled. Clickety clack, clickety clack on the rickety bridge, he made it across. Then he pulled himself together. ""I don't think you will."" He said. And he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. Well."
48,00:06:58,2021-05-04 18:15:16,Parent,"Then the Billy goat gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big hairy troll, I'm happy to say that he was never seen again. Book shelved. The end."
49,00:07:12,2021-05-04 18:15:30,Child,I want to read now that mouse.
50,00:07:17,2021-05-04 18:15:35,Parent,No hold on.
51,00:07:17,2021-05-04 18:15:35,Robot,That was a great story.
52,00:07:17,2021-05-04 18:15:35,Parent,(laughs)
53,00:07:21,2021-05-04 18:15:39,Robot,Want to read another one?
54,00:07:22,2021-05-04 18:15:40,Child,I want to read the mouse one.
55,00:07:24,2021-05-04 18:15:42,Parent,"Now you say, ""Yes please."""
56,00:07:26,2021-05-04 18:15:44,Child,Yes please.
57,00:07:29,2021-05-04 18:15:47,Parent,"Okay. Geraldine, The Music Mouse?"
58,00:07:30,2021-05-04 18:15:48,Child,Yeah.
59,00:07:34,2021-05-04 18:15:52,Parent,"All right. Geraldine, The Music Mouse, by Leo Lionni."
60,00:07:41,2021-05-04 18:15:59,Child,I think that's him.
61,00:07:42,2021-05-04 18:16:00,Parent,"[inaudible 00:07:42] All right, another book we haven't read. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Mini noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water. Please stop. The rushing of water and the meows of cats in the courtyard."
62,00:07:58,2021-05-04 18:16:16,Child,Meow. Meow.
63,00:08:01,2021-05-04 18:16:19,Parent,Meow.
64,00:08:01,2021-05-04 18:16:19,Child,[inaudible 00:08:01]
65,00:08:01,2021-05-04 18:16:19,Parent,"And of course ... He, we read the [inaudible 00:08:05], but, but right now he's not, he's just listening."
66,00:08:10,2021-05-04 18:16:28,Child,Okay.
67,00:08:10,2021-05-04 18:16:28,Parent,"And of course the soft peeping of mice. But music? Never. Then one morning ... Hmm. In the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen."
68,00:08:25,2021-05-04 18:16:43,Child,That's it.
69,00:08:28,2021-05-04 18:16:46,Parent,"That's the cheese. I was just gonna ask you if you [inaudible 00:08:29]. The largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn?"
70,00:08:39,2021-05-04 18:16:57,Child,In the barn?
71,00:08:39,2021-05-04 18:16:57,Parent,"Yeah, she has to take the whole thing to her barn. She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout ..."" She said. ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends who loved cheese happily agreed. ""Let's go!"" They said. And off then went."
72,00:09:02,2021-05-04 18:17:20,Parent,"""It's enormous. It's gigantic. It's immense. It's fantastic."" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and, finally, they managed to carry it out, or, carry it to Geraldine's hideout. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth in and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. So what is she doing?"
73,00:09:29,2021-05-04 18:17:47,Child,Finding a piece for them to eat.
74,00:09:31,2021-05-04 18:17:49,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Because she said that if they helped her, what?"
75,00:09:34,2021-05-04 18:17:52,Child,She would get them a piece to eat.
76,00:09:36,2021-05-04 18:17:54,Parent,"Yes, I'm just making sure you're listening. Okay. So, as her friends carried away their cheese to bits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears. Cheese ears?"
77,00:09:52,2021-05-04 18:18:10,Child,(laughs)
78,00:09:55,2021-05-04 18:18:13,Parent,"(laughs) As soon as her friends were gone she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the [inaudible 00:10:04] she had [inaudible 00:10:05]. She could hardly believe what she saw."
79,00:10:11,2021-05-04 18:18:29,Parent,"The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden of solid cheese. Two, its puckered lips, it held a flu- it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Do you think she's making that mouse or do you think it's in the cheese?"
80,00:10:33,2021-05-04 18:18:51,Child,"I think it's in the cheese. I mean, she's making it."
81,00:10:35,2021-05-04 18:18:53,Parent,You think so?
82,00:10:35,2021-05-04 18:18:53,Child,Yeah.
83,00:10:38,2021-05-04 18:18:56,Parent,Yeah? She's sculpting it?
84,00:10:39,2021-05-04 18:18:57,Child,Yeah.
85,00:10:40,2021-05-04 18:18:58,Parent,"[inaudible 00:10:40] Have you ever ... Have you ... We've never made anything with clay, have we? Well, we've made things with Play-Doh."
86,00:10:49,2021-05-04 18:19:07,Child,Yeah.
87,00:10:49,2021-05-04 18:19:07,Parent,"You know when you make it and you, you form the clay into things? It's called, like-"
88,00:10:49,2021-05-04 18:19:07,Child,"Wait, mom."
89,00:10:49,2021-05-04 18:19:07,Parent,... sculpting. Hold on.
90,00:10:50,2021-05-04 18:19:08,Child,Mom?
91,00:10:50,2021-05-04 18:19:08,Parent,"I'm sorry, what?"
92,00:10:52,2021-05-04 18:19:10,Child,Can [inaudible 00:10:52] Play-Doh [inaudible 00:10:54]
93,00:11:02,2021-05-04 18:19:20,Parent,"Not right now, but this is just for reading. I just wanted you to understand what she was doing. So then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Oh, look at that."
94,00:11:07,2021-05-04 18:19:25,Child,Yeah.
95,00:11:08,2021-05-04 18:19:26,Parent,"Astonished, exhausted and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. [inaudible 00:11:24]"
96,00:11:24,2021-05-04 18:19:42,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
97,00:11:27,2021-05-04 18:19:45,Parent,"As it grew darker and the sound became a clear ... became clearer and more [inaudible 00:11:32] until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible streams of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music?"" She thought. [inaudible 00:11:42] ""This must be music."" She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window panes. Do you like this story?"
98,00:11:54,2021-05-04 18:20:12,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
99,00:11:56,2021-05-04 18:20:14,Parent,"Okay. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped all together. ""Play, play!"" Geraldine begged. ""Play some more."" But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought, as she gab- gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. Do you think it'll play again?"
100,00:12:21,2021-05-04 18:20:39,Child,Yeah.
101,00:12:21,2021-05-04 18:20:39,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Let's see. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question."
102,00:12:27,2021-05-04 18:20:45,Child,Tomorrow.
103,00:12:28,2021-05-04 18:20:46,Parent,"Tomorrow? We'll see. The music began faintly at dusk, and lasted until the break of day. So that means what? That it says ... And so, night after the night, the cheese flute is played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight they lingered in her ears. So it only played at what time?"
104,00:12:45,2021-05-04 18:21:03,Child,Night.
105,00:12:47,2021-05-04 18:21:05,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Then one day she met her friends on the street, they were desperate. ""Geraldine."" They said. ""We have no more food and there's none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""That is not possible."" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others, angrily. ""Because, because, because it is music."""
106,00:13:10,2021-05-04 18:21:28,Parent,"Her friends looked at Geraldine surprised. ""What is music?"" They all asked. They asked all together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought, then she took a step backwards, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew. What are they doing?"
107,00:13:28,2021-05-04 18:21:46,Child,Nothing.
108,00:13:29,2021-05-04 18:21:47,Parent,Why?
109,00:13:33,2021-05-04 18:21:51,Child,Cause she ... Cause they're laughing because it's funny.
110,00:13:36,2021-05-04 18:21:54,Parent,Because she's blowing on her tail. (laughs)
111,00:13:37,2021-05-04 18:21:55,Child,Yeah.
112,00:13:38,2021-05-04 18:21:56,Parent,"Okay. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. Then a long, soft [inaudible 00:13:51] whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement."
113,00:14:00,2021-05-04 18:22:18,Parent,"Uh, other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group whispered, ""This is music, Geraldine? You are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No."" Said Geraldine, joyfully. ""Now we can eat the cheese, because now the music is in me."""
114,00:14:20,2021-05-04 18:22:38,Parent,"With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. That means until they were full and happy. Did you like that one?"
115,00:14:40,2021-05-04 18:22:58,Child,Yeah. Now-
116,00:14:40,2021-05-04 18:22:58,Parent,"That was cool. Hold on, let's see with Jibo wants us to do. Another book, Jibo?"
117,00:14:41,2021-05-04 18:22:59,Robot,That was a great story.
118,00:14:41,2021-05-04 18:22:59,Parent,(laughs)
119,00:14:44,2021-05-04 18:23:02,Robot,That's it for today's session.
120,00:14:46,2021-05-04 18:23:04,Parent,Oh.
121,00:14:48,2021-05-04 18:23:06,Robot,I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly.
122,00:14:59,2021-05-04 18:23:17,Parent,[inaudible 00:14:59]
123,00:14:59,2021-05-04 18:23:17,Robot,"Oh, and please-"
124,00:15:00,2021-05-04 18:23:18,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
125,00:15:01,2021-05-04 18:23:19,Robot,... complete the story survey and sign up for the next session. Thank you.
