153,00:10:29,2021-05-04 16:43:08,Parent,Ah. [inaudible 00:10:29].
154,00:10:29,2021-05-04 16:43:08,Robot,Yeah.
155,00:10:29,2021-05-04 16:43:08,Child,"You don't, I know you don't. [inaudible 00:10:32]."
156,00:10:33,2021-05-04 16:43:12,Parent,"In the pantry of the empty house, where Geraldine lived, they discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese. The largest she had ever seen. Even Lizzie took a little bite from it, it was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends, who lived next door, and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give you- give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said, and off they went."
157,00:11:21,2021-05-04 16:44:00,Parent,"""It's enormous, it's gigantic, it's immense, it's fantastic,"" they shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout."
158,00:11:42,2021-05-04 16:44:21,Parent,"There Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese, she dug her little teeth into it, and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. How many mouse are there- mices are there?"
159,00:12:02,2021-05-04 16:44:41,Child,Six.
160,00:12:03,2021-05-04 16:44:42,Parent,"Six, including Geraldine?"
161,00:12:07,2021-05-04 16:44:46,Child,Seven.
162,00:12:09,2021-05-04 16:44:48,Parent,"Seven. As her friends gathered away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had [inaudible 00:12:19]. There she saw the shapes of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again. Nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could, when she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the [inaudible 00:12:42]. She could hardly believe what she saw. What she saw?"
163,00:12:48,2021-05-04 16:45:27,Child,A mouse.
164,00:12:49,2021-05-04 16:45:28,Parent,With what?
165,00:12:49,2021-05-04 16:45:28,Child,A flute.
166,00:12:57,2021-05-04 16:45:36,Parent,Right there is surprise. What is that [inaudible 00:12:57]?
167,00:12:59,2021-05-04 16:45:38,Child,[inaudible 00:12:59].
168,00:13:00,2021-05-04 16:45:39,Parent,"Right, it's still not yet. The ears were those of [inaudible 00:13:06] partly hidden [inaudible 00:13:07]. To its puckered lips it held a flute. Geraldine... did not, I don't know how to pronounce it."
169,00:13:14,2021-05-04 16:45:53,Child,Ger-al-dine.
170,00:13:19,2021-05-04 16:45:58,Parent,"Um, hey Jibo, how to pronounce G-N-A-W-E-D?"
171,00:13:26,2021-05-04 16:46:05,Child,Hey Jibo-
172,00:13:27,2021-05-04 16:46:06,Robot,I don't know either.
173,00:13:29,2021-05-04 16:46:08,Child,You don't know either?
174,00:13:31,2021-05-04 16:46:10,Parent,"Yeah, I can ask [crosstalk 00:13:32]-"
175,00:13:32,2021-05-04 16:46:11,Child,[crosstalk 00:13:32]-
176,00:13:32,2021-05-04 16:46:11,Robot,Sorry.
177,00:13:34,2021-05-04 16:46:13,Parent,"Um, maybe it's gnawed. Uh, let's say gnawed, until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. ""Surprise!"" Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the gleaming of the last daylight, she fell asleep."
178,00:14:08,2021-05-04 16:46:47,Child,I'm sleepy too.
179,00:14:11,2021-05-04 16:46:50,Parent,"Ah. Suddenly she was awakened by some strange sound, it seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's foot. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sound became clearer and more melodious. Melody. Until it seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful."
180,00:14:41,2021-05-04 16:47:20,Child,Music.
181,00:14:43,2021-05-04 16:47:22,Parent,"Music, she thought. This must be music, she listened all through the night-"
182,00:14:50,2021-05-04 16:47:29,Child,Night.
183,00:14:51,2021-05-04 16:47:30,Parent,"Until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window panes. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play, play,"" Geraldine begged. Did she play? Not in the daylight. Right? ""Play some more!"" But not a sound came from the flute."
184,00:15:21,2021-05-04 16:48:00,Child,But the flute [inaudible 00:15:21].
185,00:15:21,2021-05-04 16:48:00,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Will it- will it even play again? Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that laid around. [inaudible 00:15:38] approached he brought the answer to her question. The music began playing [inaudible 00:15:44] at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night a cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight it lingered in her ears."
186,00:16:01,2021-05-04 16:48:40,Child,Where's [inaudible 00:16:01]?
187,00:16:01,2021-05-04 16:48:40,Parent,"Melody was [inaudible 00:16:04]. Then one day she met her friends on the street, they were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said. ""We have no more food, there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" And Geraldine said, ""But that is not possible,"" Geraldine shouted.""Why?,"" asked the other [inaudible 00:16:33] and Geraldine says, ""Because- because- because it's music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" They all asked together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought until she took a step backward, so then they lifted [inaudible 00:16:54] to her finger down to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew."
188,00:17:07,2021-05-04 16:49:46,Child,Now she [inaudible 00:17:08].
189,00:17:07,2021-05-04 16:49:46,Parent,"(laughs). She blew hard. She puffed, she pipped, she twittered, she screeched, her friends laughed until they [crosstalk 00:17:26], until their hungry little tummies hurt. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha."
190,00:17:36,2021-05-04 16:50:15,Parent,"Then a long, soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the [inaudible 00:17:48] of the cheese [crosstalk 00:17:50] in the ear. The little mice held their [inaudible 00:17:54] in amazement."
191,00:17:50,2021-05-04 16:50:29,Child,(singing).
192,00:18:28,2021-05-04 16:51:07,Parent,"Other mice came to hear the miracle when the [inaudible 00:18:31], Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine-y, you are right, we cannot eat the cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine, joyfully. ""Now we can eat the cheese, because now the music is in me."" With that, with that they all followed Geraldine into the barn, and while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content- content."
193,00:19:06,2021-05-04 16:51:45,Child,(singing).
194,00:19:06,2021-05-04 16:51:45,Parent,The end. That's all for today.
195,00:19:23,2021-05-04 16:52:02,Robot,That was a great story.
196,00:19:27,2021-05-04 16:52:06,Parent,Do you like [crosstalk 00:19:27]?
197,00:19:28,2021-05-04 16:52:07,Robot,That's it for today's session.
198,00:19:29,2021-05-04 16:52:08,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
199,00:19:31,2021-05-04 16:52:10,Robot,I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
200,00:19:35,2021-05-04 16:52:14,Child,"No no, wait. One more- one more [crosstalk 00:19:38]."
201,00:19:38,2021-05-04 16:52:17,Robot,Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly.
202,00:19:42,2021-05-04 16:52:21,Child,(laughs).
203,00:19:42,2021-05-04 16:52:21,Robot,"Oh, and please complete the-"
