5,00:00:23,2021-06-14 19:10:05,Child,I did it. Okay. Can you read some?
6,00:00:28,2021-06-14 19:10:10,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Once upon a time... This is The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now, be sure to write,"" she said, ""And remember that I love you."" One, two, three pigs. The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man."
7,00:01:03,2021-06-14 19:10:45,Robot,[inaudible 00:01:03]. Why did the man think it is not a good idea?
8,00:01:19,2021-06-14 19:11:01,Child,Because then... Because he knows there's a wolf and he will blow it down. [inaudible 00:01:19].
9,00:01:22,2021-06-14 19:11:04,Parent,"""Mind your own business, thank you,"" said the little pig, and he bought the straw and set about building a house that took him no time at all. Very soon a mean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So, he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" to which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of the chinny chin chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So, the wolf huf- huffed and he puffed and he..."
10,00:01:22,2021-06-14 19:11:04,Child,Puff.
11,00:01:55,2021-06-14 19:11:37,Parent,And he?
12,00:01:55,2021-06-14 19:11:37,Child,He huffed.
13,00:01:56,2021-06-14 19:11:38,Parent,And he?
14,00:01:57,2021-06-14 19:11:39,Child,Puffed.
15,00:02:01,2021-06-14 19:11:43,Parent,Blew...
16,00:02:01,2021-06-14 19:11:43,Child,The house down.
17,00:02:03,2021-06-14 19:11:45,Parent,And he gobbled up the little pig.
18,00:02:03,2021-06-14 19:11:45,Child,Does he eat it?
19,00:02:07,2021-06-14 19:11:49,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. ""Oh, poo,"" said the little pig, ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building the house. ""Very pretty,"" he said. What do you think is going to happen with the house of twigs?"
20,00:02:30,2021-06-14 19:12:12,Child,"Uh, same thing."
21,00:02:34,2021-06-14 19:12:16,Parent,"Let's see. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house that the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" to which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."""
22,00:02:52,2021-06-14 19:12:34,Child,Then- then he will huff and he'll blow and [inaudible 00:02:52].
23,00:02:51,2021-06-14 19:12:33,Parent,Your house...

25,00:03:08,2021-06-14 19:12:50,Parent,"Now the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea my good fellow,"" said the little pig. So, he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. Nice and solid. But no sooner... I've got to [inaudible 00:03:28] something. I'm sorry."
26,00:03:32,2021-06-14 19:13:14,Child,[inaudible 00:03:32].
27,00:03:37,2021-06-14 19:13:19,Parent,"Okay. But no sooner did the little pig move in that he noticed the wolf loitering about and the wolf was still hungry. He said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no. No."""
28,00:03:46,2021-06-14 19:13:28,Child,Not by the chinny... Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin.
29,00:03:52,2021-06-14 19:13:34,Parent,(laughs) Well... Oh.
30,00:03:52,2021-06-14 19:13:34,Child,"Ding, ding, ding."

32,00:03:52,2021-06-14 19:13:34,Child,What? Say that again?
33,00:03:52,2021-06-14 19:13:34,Robot,What does loitering mean?
34,00:03:52,2021-06-14 19:13:34,Child,What? What did he say?
35,00:03:57,2021-06-14 19:13:39,Parent,"What does loitering mean? Hey, Madeline and Luke, you guys are being really loud and we're [crosstalk 00:04:17] study right now."
36,00:04:19,2021-06-14 19:14:01,Child,I'm being [inaudible 00:04:19]?
37,00:04:18,2021-06-14 19:14:00,Parent,"No, you're doing great. [inaudible 00:04:21]. (laughs) Okay, what does loitering mean? So-"
38,00:04:18,2021-06-14 19:14:00,Child,What's that mean?
39,00:04:18,2021-06-14 19:14:00,Parent,"Okay, I don't know."
40,00:04:18,2021-06-14 19:14:00,Child,Wait a minute. I know.
41,00:04:18,2021-06-14 19:14:00,Robot,What was the wolf doing outside of the third pig's house?
42,00:04:25,2021-06-14 19:14:07,Child,Looking at the house. That's [inaudible 00:04:50].
43,00:04:50,2021-06-14 19:14:32,Robot,[inaudible 00:04:50].
44,00:04:50,2021-06-14 19:14:32,Parent,Sit up.
45,00:04:50,2021-06-14 19:14:32,Child,Looking at a house.
46,00:04:51,2021-06-14 19:14:33,Parent,"It means something like standing around, right? Yeah. Well, the wolf had heard that before and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house st- stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf."
47,00:05:23,2021-06-14 19:15:05,Child,I know what it is.
48,00:05:24,2021-06-14 19:15:06,Parent,What is it? What do you think is going to happen?
49,00:05:29,2021-06-14 19:15:11,Child,He's going to [inaudible 00:05:29].
50,00:05:29,2021-06-14 19:15:11,Parent,"And he put on his little [inaudible 00:05:33]. ""Little pig. I was only teasing,"" he said, ""By the way [inaudible 00:05:35] that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now,"" said the little pig, ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf, ""I'll come for you at 6:00."" So, the little wolf was going to go get turnips. The next morning the little pig got up at 5:00, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basketful of scrumptious turnips and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6:00 the turnips were already boiling in the pot. Oh. So, what did he do? What did the little pig do?"
51,00:06:15,2021-06-14 19:15:57,Child,"So, he um, so, he went there and he got um, the scrump things already so he didn't need to go with him."
52,00:06:24,2021-06-14 19:16:06,Parent,"Oh, that's right. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done,"" he said, ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree down in Merry Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnip,"" said the little pig, ""Lets meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf, ""Shall we say at 5:00?"""
53,00:06:48,2021-06-14 19:16:30,Robot,Why did the wolf say splendid?
54,00:06:50,2021-06-14 19:16:32,Child,"Um, because he, because he couldn't wait."
55,00:06:57,2021-06-14 19:16:39,Parent,And where's he going to eat the little pig?
56,00:07:03,2021-06-14 19:16:45,Child,[inaudible 00:07:03].
57,00:07:04,2021-06-14 19:16:46,Parent,"The next morning the little pig went at 4:00 and went after the apples. It took longer than he'd expected to reach Merry Meadows. He's all busy gathering apples and at the last tree he saw the wolf approaching. ""You try one of these,"" he called out, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. The next day the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go, uh, care to go a fair with me tomorrow, go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there,"" said the little pig, ""Would 3:00 suit you?"" ""Colossal,"" said the wolf."
58,00:07:49,2021-06-14 19:17:31,Robot,"Luke, why did the wolf keep asking the pig out to different places?"
59,00:07:51,2021-06-14 19:17:33,Child,"Because he wanted to eat it, uh, the pig."
60,00:07:58,2021-06-14 19:17:40,Parent,"Nice. Three it is, just to make sure you'll be there at 2:00. At 1:00 in the afternoon the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the h- hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill towards wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared he ran all the way home. That evening the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" Said the little pig. That great round thing was a butter churn and I was inside. This was simple too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been [inaudible 00:08:42] nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now,"" and he climbed up to the roof. When the little pig saw this he put on a big iron pot in the fire place and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf, ""Dinnertime."""
61,00:09:05,2021-06-14 19:18:47,Child,Ha ha.
62,00:09:09,2021-06-14 19:18:51,Parent,You can say that again said the little pig. And he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up.
63,00:09:26,2021-06-14 19:19:08,Child,That mean he gobbled [inaudible 00:09:26].
64,00:09:26,2021-06-14 19:19:08,Parent,(laughs) The end.
65,00:09:26,2021-06-14 19:19:08,Child,[inaudible 00:09:26].
66,00:09:26,2021-06-14 19:19:08,Parent,"Okay, you flip what you need to."
67,00:09:27,2021-06-14 19:19:09,Robot,"Hey Luke, how did the pig feel here?"
68,00:09:29,2021-06-14 19:19:11,Child,Happy.
69,00:09:38,2021-06-14 19:19:20,Parent,(laughs)
70,00:09:38,2021-06-14 19:19:20,Child,[inaudible 00:09:38].

72,00:09:40,2021-06-14 19:19:22,Child,What?
73,00:09:40,2021-06-14 19:19:22,Parent,"He said, ha ha."
74,00:09:45,2021-06-14 19:19:27,Child,"Um, Jibo [inaudible 00:09:54]."
75,00:09:53,2021-06-14 19:19:35,Parent,Are you feeling tired?
76,00:09:54,2021-06-14 19:19:36,Robot,Yes.
77,00:10:04,2021-06-14 19:19:46,Child,Good night Jibo. Good night.

81,00:10:13,2021-06-14 19:19:55,Child,Yeah.
