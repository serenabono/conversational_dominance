""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""Oh it's only I, the second billy goat Gruff and I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the billy goat, and his voice was not so small. ""No you're not,"" said the troll, ""for I'm coming to gobble you up."" ""Oh please don't take me, wait a little till the third billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."" ""Well then be off with you,"" said the troll. Oops. Whoa. Then up came the third billy goat Gruff. Trip, trap, trip, trap went the bridge. The third billy goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. ""Who's that tromping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""It's I, the big billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat and he voi- His voice was as loud as the troll's. ""No, I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the troll. ""Well come along,"" said the big billy goat Gruff, ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves, see what you can do."" So up climbed that mean, ugly troll and the big billy goat Gruff butted him with his horns and he trampled him with his hard hooves and he tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river."

In the meadow the three billy goats Gruff got so fat that they could hardly walk home again. They're probably there yet, so snip, snap, snap they still stalk out. Shall we read one more?"
50,00:05:10,2021-05-13 17:19:52,Child 1,Yeah.
