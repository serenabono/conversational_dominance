134,00:08:47,2021-05-17 17:28:10,Parent,"Yeah, nobody help her. So why should they eat bread with her if no one helped? What would you do if you were the little red hen? Would you share your bread or you would eat it by yourself?"
135,00:08:59,2021-05-17 17:28:22,Eva,Eat it by myself.
136,00:09:02,2021-05-17 17:28:25,Parent,I agree. I would do the same thing.

157,00:09:43,2021-05-17 17:29:06,Parent,"Okay, let's read another long story. Geraldine the Music Mouse. I think I know that one."
158,00:09:55,2021-05-17 17:29:18,Eva,I don't.
159,00:09:56,2021-05-17 17:29:19,Parent,You don't?
160,00:09:56,2021-05-17 17:29:19,Speaker 2,I like [inaudible 00:09:59].
161,00:09:59,2021-05-17 17:29:22,Parent,"Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises, and noises of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. She's cute. What do you think?"
162,00:10:13,2021-05-17 17:29:36,Eva,Cutie.
163,00:10:17,2021-05-17 17:29:40,Parent,"She's so cute. And of course, the soft peeping of mice. But mi- music? Never. Then one morning, in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the [inaudible 00:10:43]? Do you have an idea how she could take it?"
164,00:10:45,2021-05-17 17:30:08,Eva,No.
165,00:10:48,2021-05-17 17:30:11,Parent,"She ran to her friends, who lived next door, and told them about her discovery, ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said, and off they went. Well, Geraldine's friends are more helpful that little red hen's friends."
166,00:11:08,2021-05-17 17:30:31,Eva,Uh-huh.
167,00:11:13,2021-05-17 17:30:36,Parent,"It's enormous. It's gi- gigantic. It's immense. It's fantastic. They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged, and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. How many mice had to carry the cheese?"
168,00:11:29,2021-05-17 17:30:52,Eva,"One, two, three, four, five, six."
169,00:11:33,2021-05-17 17:30:56,Parent,Wow. Must have been a big piece of Parmesan cheese. Do you like Parmesan cheese?
170,00:11:33,2021-05-17 17:30:56,Eva,Yes.
171,00:11:33,2021-05-17 17:30:56,Parent,I love it.
172,00:11:33,2021-05-17 17:30:56,Speaker 2,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
173,00:11:40,2021-05-17 17:31:03,Parent,Do you love it too? Yeah? We all like Parmesan cheese in this house.
174,00:11:43,2021-05-17 17:31:06,Speaker 2,Mm.
175,00:11:45,2021-05-17 17:31:08,Parent,"There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had [inaudible 00:12:02]. Then she saw the shapes of two enormous ears, cheese ears! What do you think Geraldine is making?"
176,00:12:11,2021-05-17 17:31:34,Eva,A sculpture.
177,00:12:12,2021-05-17 17:31:35,Parent,Ah. A cheese sculpture.
178,00:12:16,2021-05-17 17:31:39,Eva,[inaudible 00:12:16]...
179,00:12:17,2021-05-17 17:31:40,Parent,"I think that's going to be the tastiest sculpture ever existed. As soon as her friends were done, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at [inaudible 00:12:30] the forms she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. [inaudible 00:12:36] Parmesan cheese?"
180,00:12:38,2021-05-17 17:32:01,Eva,Um...
181,00:12:39,2021-05-17 17:32:02,Parent,Yeah. I'm going to take a piece of Parmesan cheese. Mm.
182,00:12:44,2021-05-17 17:32:07,Eva,I got the biggest one. I took this one.
183,00:12:44,2021-05-17 17:32:07,Parent,(laughs).
184,00:12:44,2021-05-17 17:32:07,Eva,(laughs).
185,00:12:49,2021-05-17 17:32:12,Parent,"The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden, of solid cheese. To its puckered lips it held a flute. Geraldine had gnawed and gnawed it until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. I think I want to eat the cheese mouse too."
186,00:13:05,2021-05-17 17:32:28,Speaker 2,[inaudible 00:13:05] ew- ew.
187,00:13:05,2021-05-17 17:32:28,Parent,"Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at this cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. I think she must have been really tired after all this nibbling. Suddenly, she was awake by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. What do you think was happening?"
188,00:13:05,2021-05-17 17:32:28,Eva,The mouse became real?
189,00:13:40,2021-05-17 17:33:03,Parent,"It seems like it. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. Music, she thought. This must be music. She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn flickered through the dusty windowpanes. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it played altogether. Play, play, Geraldine begged. Play some more. But not a sound came from the flute. Will it ever play again? Eva, what do you think? Will it ever play again?"
190,00:14:34,2021-05-17 17:33:57,Eva,"Uh, yes."
191,00:14:37,2021-05-17 17:34:00,Parent,"Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day."
192,00:14:50,2021-05-17 17:34:13,Speaker 2,I wanted [crosstalk 00:14:50] dancies.
193,00:14:51,2021-05-17 17:34:14,Parent,"This is [inaudible 00:14:51]... Eva [inaudible 00:14:52]... And so, night after night, the cheese flute is playing for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight they lingered in her ears. Then, one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" Do you think Geraldine will say?"
194,00:15:20,2021-05-17 17:34:43,Eva,No.
195,00:15:23,2021-05-17 17:34:46,Parent,"This is not possible. But why? Asked the others, angrily. Because, because, because it is music. Her friends looked a Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" They asked all together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath, and blew."
196,00:15:47,2021-05-17 17:35:10,Robot,"Eva, I think it's a good time for you to ask us a question."
197,00:15:55,2021-05-17 17:35:18,Parent,Do you have a question?
198,00:15:56,2021-05-17 17:35:19,Eva,Uh-huh. Why do the other mice not believe her that music is real?
199,00:16:02,2021-05-17 17:35:25,Parent,What do you think?
200,00:16:02,2021-05-17 17:35:25,Eva,I don't know.
201,00:16:07,2021-05-17 17:35:30,Speaker 2,[crosstalk 00:16:07] [inaudible 00:16:07]...
202,00:16:10,2021-05-17 17:35:33,Eva,Because they never heard music like her?
203,00:16:11,2021-05-17 17:35:34,Robot,That is a great question.
204,00:16:11,2021-05-17 17:35:34,Speaker 2,[inaudible 00:16:11]...
205,00:16:11,2021-05-17 17:35:34,Parent,Maybe [inaudible 00:16:11] heard music or they couldn't believe that [crosstalk 00:16:11] play music.
206,00:16:15,2021-05-17 17:35:38,Speaker 2,(singing).
207,00:16:20,2021-05-17 17:35:43,Eva,Okay [crosstalk 00:16:21]...
208,00:16:22,2021-05-17 17:35:45,Robot,Do you know why?
209,00:16:25,2021-05-17 17:35:48,Parent,But what is Geraldine doing? It seems like Geraldine is playing music with her...
210,00:16:29,2021-05-17 17:35:52,Eva,"Tail, like the mouse?"
211,00:16:31,2021-05-17 17:35:54,Speaker 2,(singing).
212,00:16:31,2021-05-17 17:35:54,Parent,Isn't that a little crazy?
213,00:16:35,2021-05-17 17:35:58,Eva,[inaudible 00:16:35]...
214,00:16:35,2021-05-17 17:35:58,Speaker 2,(singing).
215,00:16:38,2021-05-17 17:36:01,Parent,"She blew hard. She puffed and she peeped, she [inaudible 00:16:43], she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tongues hurt. Can Geraldine play music with her tail?"
216,00:16:38,2021-05-17 17:36:01,Eva,No.
217,00:16:51,2021-05-17 17:36:14,Parent,"Then a long, soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. It's looks like she finally did it. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the youngest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you're right. We cannot eat that cheese."" I think Jibo is getting a bit n- noi- noi- noisy. He's looking what you are doing."
218,00:17:25,2021-05-17 17:36:48,Eva,Mm.
219,00:17:27,2021-05-17 17:36:50,Parent,"No, said Geraldine joyfully."
220,00:17:28,2021-05-17 17:36:51,Speaker 2,Ah.
221,00:17:29,2021-05-17 17:36:52,Parent,Now [crosstalk 00:17:31] eat the cheese.
222,00:17:32,2021-05-17 17:36:55,Speaker 2,[crosstalk 00:17:32] mama.
223,00:17:32,2021-05-17 17:36:55,Eva,[crosstalk 00:17:32].
224,00:17:32,2021-05-17 17:36:55,Parent,"Because now the music is in me. With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn and while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. The end."
225,00:17:49,2021-05-17 17:37:12,Eva,The end. [foreign language 00:17:49].
226,00:17:51,2021-05-17 17:37:14,Parent,"Yeah, yeah. I think we're done. Which book did you like best?"
227,00:17:54,2021-05-17 17:37:17,Eva,[crosstalk 00:17:54]-
228,00:17:54,2021-05-17 17:37:17,Robot,"I love all the questions you asked today, Eva."
229,00:17:59,2021-05-17 17:37:22,Parent,Which book did you like best?
230,00:17:59,2021-05-17 17:37:22,Eva,All.
231,00:18:02,2021-05-17 17:37:25,Parent,All? Do you have a favorite one?
232,00:18:04,2021-05-17 17:37:27,Eva,[crosstalk 00:18:04]...
233,00:18:04,2021-05-17 17:37:27,Parent,[foreign language 00:18:04].
234,00:18:06,2021-05-17 17:37:29,Eva,[foreign language 00:18:06]...
235,00:18:13,2021-05-17 17:37:36,Parent,"Okay, can you ask Jibo to go back to leisure mode?"
236,00:18:21,2021-05-17 17:37:44,Eva,[inaudible 00:18:21]...
237,00:18:21,2021-05-17 17:37:44,Speaker 2,[inaudible 00:18:21].
238,00:18:21,2021-05-17 17:37:44,Parent,"Hey, Jibo, can you turn back to leisure mode?"
239,00:18:26,2021-05-17 17:37:49,Robot,Sure.
240,00:18:29,2021-05-17 17:37:52,Speaker 2,[inaudible 00:18:29].
241,00:18:31,2021-05-17 17:37:54,Robot,That was a great story.
242,00:18:34,2021-05-17 17:37:57,Others,[inaudible 00:18:34].
243,00:18:34,2021-05-17 17:37:57,Parent,"Thank you, Jibo."
244,00:18:34,2021-05-17 17:37:57,Eva,(laughs).
245,00:18:35,2021-05-17 17:37:58,Robot,That's it for today's session.
246,00:18:41,2021-05-17 17:38:04,Speaker 2,(laughs). [inaudible 00:18:41]...
247,00:18:41,2021-05-17 17:38:04,Robot,[crosstalk 00:18:41] so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
248,00:18:44,2021-05-17 17:38:07,Speaker 2,[inaudible 00:18:44]...
249,00:18:44,2021-05-17 17:38:07,Robot,[crosstalk 00:18:44] give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to-
