118,00:12:55,2021-05-16 20:45:54,Child,"As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed up, having a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw."
119,00:13:09,2021-05-16 20:46:08,Parent,What did she see?

126,00:13:31,2021-05-16 20:46:30,Child,Then she realized the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail.
127,00:13:31,2021-05-16 20:46:30,Parent,Astonished.
128,00:13:32,2021-05-16 20:46:31,Child,"Astonish... exhaust, and afraid, Geraldine stared at the cheese station with the dimming of the last daylight she fell asleep. Soon she was awakened by something strange sound. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse flute. She's jumped [inaudible 00:14:01]. As it grew darker, the sound became clearer.
