1,00:00:35,2021-07-16 08:28:40,Robot,One moment.
2,00:00:39,2021-07-16 08:28:44,Child,Why are you looking [inaudible 00:00:42].
3,00:00:42,2021-07-16 08:28:47,Robot,I am in the story mode now.
4,00:00:44,2021-07-16 08:28:49,Parent,"Oh, you are in story mode? He's in story mode. Are you going to dance with him this morning."
5,00:00:57,2021-07-16 08:29:02,Robot,Hello.
6,00:00:59,2021-07-16 08:29:04,Parent,Hello Jibo!
7,00:01:01,2021-07-16 08:29:06,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
8,00:01:22,2021-07-16 08:29:27,Parent,"Choose a book. [Titi 00:01:25], which book would you like?"
9,00:01:27,2021-07-16 08:29:32,Child,[inaudible 00:01:27].
10,00:01:27,2021-07-16 08:29:32,Parent,Choose it.
11,00:01:32,2021-07-16 08:29:37,Child,[inaudible 00:01:32] get to show it.
12,00:01:35,2021-07-16 08:29:40,Parent,"Uh, Geraldine the Music Mouse, Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Little Red Hen, The Little Red Hen, Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Year Fall, Spring, Summer at the Maple Farm, or Three Little Pigs. Which one? I don't think we read Summer at the Farm. Do you want to read sum- or do you want to read Geraldine the Music Mouse. We haven't read that one in a while."
13,00:02:02,2021-07-16 08:30:07,Child,[inaudible 00:02:02].
14,00:02:06,2021-07-16 08:30:11,Parent,"No. Geraldine the Music Mouse. No? Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of doors, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. Do you want to make any of those noises?"
15,00:02:30,2021-07-16 08:30:35,Child,"Meow, meow."
16,00:02:32,2021-07-16 08:30:37,Parent,I just heard a slamming of door. Barking of dog.
17,00:02:35,2021-07-16 08:30:40,Child,"Woof, woof, woof."
18,00:02:37,2021-07-16 08:30:42,Parent,"Uh, rushing of water. Do you know what that sounds like?"
19,00:02:37,2021-07-16 08:30:42,Child,Shh-shh-shh.
20,00:02:42,2021-07-16 08:30:47,Parent,Great. And of course the soft peeping of mice.
21,00:02:48,2021-07-16 08:30:53,Child,"Peep, peep, peep."
22,00:02:52,2021-07-16 08:30:57,Parent,"Sometimes in English we say squeak, squeak, squeak. But music, never. Then, one morning in the pantry of the house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of parmesan cheese. She eat ... Oh, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her, uh ... to her secret hideout in the barn."
23,00:03:23,2021-07-16 08:31:28,Robot,How is music different from noise.
24,00:03:24,2021-07-16 08:31:29,Parent,"[inaudible 00:03:24], how is the music different from noise? Must be noises that you like. Is it noises that you like a lot? I think it is just noise that you like a lot."
25,00:03:48,2021-07-16 08:31:53,Robot,I like that.
26,00:03:49,2021-07-16 08:31:54,Parent,"How would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who love cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said, and off they went. ""It's enormous! It's gigantic! It's immense! It's fantastic!"" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged until finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese, she dug her little teeth into it, and pulled away a crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. Which is ... What is a crumb and what is a chunk?"
27,00:04:40,2021-07-16 08:32:45,Child,A crumb is tiny and a chunk is big.
28,00:04:45,2021-07-16 08:32:50,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears, cheese ears. Oh, it's interesting. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. What's- what can you see, Titi."
29,00:05:19,2021-07-16 08:33:24,Child,A mouse!
30,00:05:20,2021-07-16 08:33:25,Parent,"It's starting to look like a mouse. Their ears, uh ... The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Isn't it funny how spell gnawed?"
31,00:05:41,2021-07-16 08:33:46,Robot,Hey Margaret.
32,00:05:41,2021-07-16 08:33:46,Parent,Yes.
33,00:05:42,2021-07-16 08:33:47,Robot,Why does the cheese mouse have puckered lips?
34,00:05:45,2021-07-16 08:33:50,Parent,"Do you know what puckered lips are, Titi? When you go like this. To play a flute you have to put your ... you have to blow the air from your mouth in a special way, and so you need to put your lips in a special shape to- to play each different instrument. So, flute, you have to put in a special way, clarinet, you have to put in another way, oboe, you have to put in another way. So, you have to put your lips special to play the- the flute."
35,00:06:16,2021-07-16 08:34:21,Robot,Can you show me how you would blow into the flute like the mouse did?
36,00:06:21,2021-07-16 08:34:26,Parent,"Titi, show it."
37,00:06:23,2021-07-16 08:34:28,Robot,Awesome.
38,00:06:26,2021-07-16 08:34:31,Parent,"Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last day- day ... of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She got to her feet. What do you think it sounds like, Titi? Maybe like that or some other noise? What kind of music do you think it would be? As it grew darker, the sound became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music,"" she thought. ""This must be music!"" She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty windowpanes. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play! Play!"" Geraldine begged. ""Play some more."" Not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk. Do you know when dusk is? It's when the sun is starting to go down. So, as it's starting to get dark, the music started. And so, night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies and even in daylight, they lingered in her ears. Then, one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine, we have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share you cheese with us."" ""But that is not possible."" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others angrily. ""Because- because- because it is music."" Her friends looked at each other in surprise. ""What is music?"" They all asked. For a moment, Geraldine st- stood deep in thought, then she took a step backwards, solemnly lifted the tip if her tail to her puckered lips and took a deep breath and blew. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she [inaudible 00:09:02], she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. That's silly."
39,00:09:08,2021-07-16 08:37:13,Robot,"Margaret, what does solemnly mean?"
40,00:09:10,2021-07-16 08:37:15,Parent,"What does solemnly mean? Solemnly means quite serious. So, she was very serious about it and she wanted to show them. Do you see the word solemnly? Here is the word solemnly. Then, a long soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you're right, we cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully, ""Now, we can eat the cheese because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies content. This is when they say, ""Gayest of tunes,"" it means, ""happiest of tunes."""
41,00:10:16,2021-07-16 08:38:21,Child,But now how will [inaudible 00:10:19].
42,00:10:18,2021-07-16 08:38:23,Parent,"Well, Geraldine can make the music. That's the point, Titi. She learned the music and now she can do it."
43,00:10:23,2021-07-16 08:38:28,Child,And how?
44,00:10:28,2021-07-16 08:38:33,Parent,"She can learn to whistle. Can you learn to whistle, do you think?"
45,00:10:32,2021-07-16 08:38:37,Child,[inaudible 00:10:32].
46,00:10:36,2021-07-16 08:38:41,Parent,Okay. What do you want to play now?
47,00:10:38,2021-07-16 08:38:43,Child,Are they leaving now?
48,00:10:40,2021-07-16 08:38:45,Parent,No.
49,00:10:43,2021-07-16 08:38:48,Child,[inaudible 00:10:43].
50,00:10:42,2021-07-16 08:38:47,Parent,Do you want ... How about we have [inaudible 00:10:46] Summer at the Farm.
51,00:10:53,2021-07-16 08:38:58,Child,No. This one.
52,00:10:53,2021-07-16 08:38:58,Parent,Three Little Pigs?
53,00:10:53,2021-07-16 08:38:58,Child,This one.
54,00:10:54,2021-07-16 08:38:59,Parent,"Now, are you going to read this or am I going to read this? You, me, or Jibo?"
55,00:10:54,2021-07-16 08:38:59,Child,Jibo!
56,00:10:57,2021-07-16 08:39:02,Parent,"Jibo I don't think has read this story yet. Three, little, pigs."
57,00:10:57,2021-07-16 08:39:02,Child,"No, you read."
58,00:11:12,2021-07-16 08:39:17,Parent,Illustrated by-
59,00:11:14,2021-07-16 08:39:19,Child,[Thea 00:11:14].
60,00:11:17,2021-07-16 08:39:22,Parent,"[inaudible 00:11:17], yeah. A girl named Thea draw the pictures for this book. Illustrated means draw the pictures for. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in cozy house with their mother. One day, mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now. It is time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong and you will be safe from the big bad wolf."""
61,00:11:41,2021-07-16 08:39:46,Child,And now they don't-
62,00:11:44,2021-07-16 08:39:49,Parent,The first little pig was a lazy little pig. He built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful little pig. He build his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks.
63,00:12:14,2021-07-16 08:40:19,Robot,Do you think you are smart if you listen to your mom's advice?
64,00:12:18,2021-07-16 08:40:23,Parent,"Titi, sit down and put your face here. Um, what do you think, Titi? Are you smart if you listen to your mom's advice? Yes?"
65,00:12:27,2021-07-16 08:40:32,Child,Yeah.
66,00:12:28,2021-07-16 08:40:33,Parent,I think so.
67,00:12:29,2021-07-16 08:40:34,Child,"Yeah, yeah."
68,00:12:30,2021-07-16 08:40:35,Parent,The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big bad wolf.
69,00:12:40,2021-07-16 08:40:45,Child,[inaudible 00:12:40] to be a pig.
70,00:12:53,2021-07-16 08:40:58,Parent,He wanted to be a pig?
71,00:12:53,2021-07-16 08:40:58,Child,(Laughs).
72,00:12:54,2021-07-16 08:40:59,Parent,(Laughs). Do you think the wolf wanted to be a pig or do what to a pig?
73,00:12:54,2021-07-16 08:40:59,Child,He wanted to be a pig.
74,00:13:00,2021-07-16 08:41:05,Parent,I don't think he wanted to be a pig for his supper. Are you going to read?~
75,00:13:00,2021-07-16 08:41:05,Child,Ba.
76,00:13:05,2021-07-16 08:41:10,Parent,"No, Titi, read."
77,00:13:06,2021-07-16 08:41:11,Child,Ba. (Laughs).
78,00:13:09,2021-07-16 08:41:14,Parent,"Stop it, silly bucket. Look it, I like this picture, it has, kind of, a shadow of the wolf. It, kind of, makes it even spookier. Is it spooky picture? The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door."
79,00:13:23,2021-07-16 08:41:28,Child,Little pig [inaudible 00:13:24].
80,00:13:28,2021-07-16 08:41:33,Parent,"Say it in a scary wolf voice. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" You think that's how he sounded?"
81,00:13:28,2021-07-16 08:41:33,Child,(Laughs).
82,00:13:37,2021-07-16 08:41:42,Parent,How did he sound? He roared. Do you know what roar means?
83,00:13:37,2021-07-16 08:41:42,Child,Waah.
84,00:13:40,2021-07-16 08:41:45,Parent,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" And what do you think the little pig sounded like? Like, little? He's little, so what do you think he sounded like? ""Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."" Replied the first little pig. Then what did the wolf say? ""Then ... Then ..."
85,00:14:11,2021-07-16 08:42:16,Child,I'll [inaudible 00:14:11].
86,00:14:14,2021-07-16 08:42:19,Parent,"... huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"" Yelled the wolf. So, the wolf huffed and he puffed. Can you huff and puff."
87,00:14:17,2021-07-16 08:42:22,Child,You got it in my eye.
88,00:14:25,2021-07-16 08:42:30,Parent,"So, the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. [inaudible 00:14:35] Wolf knocked on the second little pig's door. Do you know what he said then?"
89,00:14:25,2021-07-16 08:42:30,Child,"Hmm, hmm, hmm."
90,00:14:42,2021-07-16 08:42:47,Parent,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" He roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin,"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"""
91,00:15:00,2021-07-16 08:43:05,Robot,Do you think the wolf can blow the house down?
92,00:15:03,2021-07-16 08:43:08,Parent,"What do you think, Titi? Yeah, looks like he did it! I think that's pig. I don't know if his-"
93,00:15:08,2021-07-16 08:43:13,Robot,Why?
94,00:15:09,2021-07-16 08:43:14,Parent,"Huh? Why? Why do you think he can do it? The picture shows he can. He must have strong lungs. So, the wolf huffed, and he puffed, he blew the sticks down, uh ... a house down. How do you think a dog would do it instead? I think they would just scratch it up with their paws. What do you think? Probably just scratch it up. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs would take him. The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. What does it mean, trembling? Shivering, shaking. But usually because you're scared. ""The big bad wolf blew our houses down,"" he cried. ""Come quick. Come inside,"" said the brother. Minutes later there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" ""Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin,"" said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"""
95,00:16:20,2021-07-16 08:44:25,Robot,Can the wolf blow down this house too?
96,00:16:23,2021-07-16 08:44:28,Parent,"What do you think, Titi?"
97,00:16:23,2021-07-16 08:44:28,Child,Mm-mm (negative). He was all ... (Laughs).
98,00:16:23,2021-07-16 08:44:28,Parent,You think he's going to do that.
99,00:16:23,2021-07-16 08:44:28,Child,(Laughs).
100,00:16:38,2021-07-16 08:44:43,Parent,"(Laughs). You think he can't blow it down? What will happen when he tries? So the wolf huffed and he puffed, then he puffed and he huffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down. Do you think ... Do you think he can blow our house down?"
101,00:17:03,2021-07-16 08:45:08,Child,No!
102,00:17:04,2021-07-16 08:45:09,Parent,"Do you think if a wolf came outside, he could blow our house down?"
103,00:17:05,2021-07-16 08:45:10,Child,I don't like to see.
104,00:17:09,2021-07-16 08:45:14,Parent,"No, I don't think they can do it."
105,00:17:09,2021-07-16 08:45:14,Child,Why?
106,00:17:09,2021-07-16 08:45:14,Parent,"Because our house is not as strong as bricks, but it's stronger than sticks or straw. The big bad wolf was very angry. What did he say?"
107,00:17:23,2021-07-16 08:45:28,Child,"""Ah, you little piggies!"""
108,00:17:26,2021-07-16 08:45:31,Parent,He snarled.
109,00:17:30,2021-07-16 08:45:35,Child,[inaudible 00:17:30].
110,00:17:37,2021-07-16 08:45:42,Parent,And-
111,00:17:37,2021-07-16 08:45:42,Child,[inaudible 00:17:37] down the chimney (laughs).
112,00:17:37,2021-07-16 08:45:42,Parent,"Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with hot crackling flames. What do you think the wolf said to that?"
113,00:17:50,2021-07-16 08:45:55,Child,"""Ow, ow, ow, ow."""
114,00:17:50,2021-07-16 08:45:55,Parent,"His tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again, and they lived happily ever after. Today-"
115,00:18:05,2021-07-16 08:46:10,Child,(Laughs).
116,00:18:08,2021-07-16 08:46:13,Parent,... you are so naughty. Ready?
117,00:18:11,2021-07-16 08:46:16,Child,(laughs).
118,00:18:13,2021-07-16 08:46:18,Parent,Don't try to blow me down. Stop it. What do-
119,00:18:20,2021-07-16 08:46:25,Child,[inaudible 00:18:20].
120,00:18:19,2021-07-16 08:46:24,Robot,"Now we have read the whole story, what saved the little pigs from the bad wolf?"
121,00:18:28,2021-07-16 08:46:33,Parent,"What saved the little pigs, Titi?"

Do you think letters have teeth? All of these letters have teeth, so they can eat, right? Do you think he only eats words that start with T?"
217,00:25:51,2021-07-16 08:53:56,Child,Maybe.
218,00:25:54,2021-07-16 08:53:59,Parent,What do you think he eats if he's not ... if it's food that starts with T.

226,00:26:14,2021-07-16 08:54:19,Parent,"I don't think I would go to a party with him if he eats other letters. Then U, V, W wiggle jiggle free. Last two come, X Y Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree. Titi, stop."

232,00:26:53,2021-07-16 08:54:58,Robot,Why do you think the letters want to go back up the tree?
233,00:27:03,2021-07-16 08:55:08,Parent,Why do you think they want to do that? Was it fun the first time? Yeah? It was fun? It must have been having a party. I think they were having a party.
