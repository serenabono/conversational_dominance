26,00:02:30,2021-06-12 10:34:33,Child,"Hmm. So ... so in this part of the, one, two, three, four, five, six. So the count by six, that's- that's si- that's six, that's six, and six plus- six plus six ... six plus six is ... is twelve."

She asked the duck, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. She asked the goose, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the goose. She asked the cat, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the cat. What's the cat doing?"
93,00:08:51,2021-06-12 10:40:54,Child,He- he's fishing.
94,00:08:51,2021-06-12 10:40:54,Parent,He is fishing.

98,00:09:56,2021-06-12 10:41:59,Parent,"That's- that's silly. If you go fishing, you should have pants on."
99,00:09:58,2021-06-12 10:42:01,Child,"(laughs) Yeah. Well, he is a cat. (laughs)"
100,00:10:00,2021-06-12 10:42:03,Parent,"Well, that's true. Cat's don't always necessarily have their pants on. A lot of cats don't."

102,00:10:15,2021-06-12 10:42:18,Parent,"Eh, that's true. She asked the pig, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the pig."
103,00:10:24,2021-06-12 10:42:27,Child,And- and they- and they don't even- they don't even have hands.
104,00:10:27,2021-06-12 10:42:30,Parent,What's the pig doing?
105,00:10:30,2021-06-12 10:42:33,Child,The pig is using a violin. And it looks like he has- has- has pants on.
106,00:10:37,2021-06-12 10:42:40,Parent,He does have pants on.

108,00:10:37,2021-06-12 10:42:40,Parent,Good- good for him.
109,00:10:47,2021-06-12 10:42:50,Child,... why does- why does he have pant- why does he have pants on? He's should be rolling around in the- he should be rolling in the- he should be rolling around in the mud.
110,00:10:49,2021-06-12 10:42:52,Parent,"Also- also, I think he could do."
111,00:10:50,2021-06-12 10:42:53,Child,He should be- he should be [inaudible 00:10:54].
112,00:10:56,2021-06-12 10:42:59,Parent,"Turn around, we gotta read that page."

116,00:10:58,2021-06-12 10:43:01,Parent,"That's okay. ""Then I will plant it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did. Good for her. Soon, the wheat grew tall and the Little Red Hen knew it was time to reap it. ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" She asked."
117,00:11:16,2021-06-12 10:43:19,Child,"""Not I, not I."""
118,00:11:21,2021-06-12 10:43:24,Parent,What's she- what's she doing right there?

120,00:11:34,2021-06-12 10:43:37,Parent,It's kinda funny that she's walking along the top of the fence. But that's okay. Hit- hit the- hit the button.

122,00:11:52,2021-06-12 10:43:55,Parent,They had to illustrate it like that?
123,00:11:56,2021-06-12 10:43:59,Child,"Ye- ye- yeah, because, yeah, because, 'cause it's the ... we wouldn't see the- we wouldn't see the, ""Bawk, bawk, ba-gawk."" And hen- the Little Red Hen, being as-"
124,00:12:16,2021-06-12 10:44:19,Parent,What would we see?
125,00:12:17,2021-06-12 10:44:20,Child,We- we- we- we- we'd see her- we- we'd see the fence.
126,00:12:22,2021-06-12 10:44:25,Parent,"Yeah, I know. ""Not I,"" said the duck, ""Not I,"" said the goose."
127,00:12:26,2021-06-12 10:44:29,Child,The- they're mean friends.
128,00:12:26,2021-06-12 10:44:29,Parent,"Nobody's helping her, huh?"

130,00:12:37,2021-06-12 10:44:40,Parent,"""Not I,"" said the cat, ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will reap it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour."
131,00:12:48,2021-06-12 10:44:51,Child,Ooh.
132,00:12:49,2021-06-12 10:44:52,Parent,"""Who will help me carry the wheat to the mill?"" She asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck, ""Not I,"" said the goose, ""Not I,"" said the cat, ""Not I,"" said the pig. Not very helpful at all."
133,00:12:57,2021-06-12 10:45:00,Robot,"What would you like to know more about the cat, duck, goose in the story?"
134,00:13:13,2021-06-12 10:45:16,Child,I- I'd like to n- I'd like know if- if she shared the bre- if she'd share the- the m- the- the- the bread or not? Eh. I've seen the story [crosstalk 00:13:28].

136,00:13:28,2021-06-12 10:45:31,Child,"Yeah, yeah, at school."
137,00:13:36,2021-06-12 10:45:39,Parent,"Okay. No, no, we'll read that page. ""Then I will carry myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did. She carried the wheat to the mill and the miller made it into flour."
138,00:13:41,2021-06-12 10:45:44,Child,"Wait, before this- the- is that ... w- what, is that how- is that- is that how you make flour?"

141,00:13:52,2021-06-12 10:45:55,Parent,"... so in the background, what you're asking about, that's called a windmill."
142,00:13:58,2021-06-12 10:46:01,Child,"Why's it called- w- why is it called a wind- wind ... well, how does it make flour?"
143,00:14:03,2021-06-12 10:46:06,Parent,"So it uses the wind and it turns a- it turns a big masher or a roller around like a- like a stone plate and you would put the- the wheat on top of that, and the- the wind would- the wind would turn the roller around and it would mash all of the wheat for you."
144,00:14:23,2021-06-12 10:46:26,Child,"Oh- oh- oh, yeah. You know- oh, you don't know but my ... nevermind, nevermind, it's a- it's a ... I saw this- saw this in the episode, the wheel came down."
145,00:14:34,2021-06-12 10:46:37,Parent,There may be more steps to that but that's how I figure it probably works.
146,00:14:39,2021-06-12 10:46:42,Child,"Yeah. I don't remember all the steps, though."
147,00:14:42,2021-06-12 10:46:45,Parent,"When it got it home, she asked, ""Who will help me make the flour into dough?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck, ""Not I,"" said the goose, ""Not I,"" said the cat [crosstalk 00:14:50]-"
148,00:14:49,2021-06-12 10:46:52,Child,When it's in the position.
149,00:14:59,2021-06-12 10:47:02,Parent,What do you think the pig- the pig said?
150,00:14:59,2021-06-12 10:47:02,Child,"""Not, eh, not I,"" said the pig."
151,00:14:59,2021-06-12 10:47:02,Parent,Exactly.
152,00:14:59,2021-06-12 10:47:02,Child,Bop.
153,00:15:01,2021-06-12 10:47:04,Parent,"""Then I will make the dough myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did. Soon, the bread was ready to go into the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" Said the Little Red Hen. ""Not I,"" [crosstalk 00:15:19] said the duck. [crosstalk 00:15:19] ""Not I,"" said the goose. [crosstalk 00:15:22] ""Not I,"" said the cat, ""Not I,"" said the pig."
154,00:15:27,2021-06-12 10:47:30,Child,What's the pig in- was not in the story.
155,00:15:28,2021-06-12 10:47:31,Parent,No?

158,00:15:32,2021-06-12 10:47:35,Child,The Little Red Hen.
159,00:15:35,2021-06-12 10:47:38,Parent,Okay. Wanna hit the- hit the next button?
160,00:15:41,2021-06-12 10:47:44,Child,So there's only- there's only three pages [inaudible 00:15:41].
161,00:15:43,2021-06-12 10:47:46,Parent,"Oh. ""Then I will bake it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen, and she did. After the loaf had been taken from the oven, it was set on the windowsill to cool. ""And now,"" said the Little Red Hen, ""Who will help me eat the bread?"" ""I will,"" said the duck. ""I will,"" said the goose, ""I will,"" said the cat, ""I will,"" said the pig. ""No, I will eat it myself,"" said the Little Red Hen."
162,00:16:16,2021-06-12 10:48:19,Child,"Uh, uh, is the [inaudible 00:16:17]-"
163,00:16:16,2021-06-12 10:48:19,Parent,And she did.
164,00:16:16,2021-06-12 10:48:19,Child,"She eats it herself. Yeah, that's-"
165,00:16:23,2021-06-12 10:48:26,Parent,Is there- is there a different version?
166,00:16:24,2021-06-12 10:48:27,Child,"Ye- yeah. Yeah, where she said- yeah, where she said yes."
167,00:16:28,2021-06-12 10:48:31,Parent,To let everybody else have some still?
168,00:16:30,2021-06-12 10:48:33,Child,Yeah.
169,00:16:41,2021-06-12 10:48:44,Parent,Uh-huh (affirmative).
170,00:16:41,2021-06-12 10:48:44,Child,Is that the end of [crosstalk 00:16:41]-
171,00:16:41,2021-06-12 10:48:44,Parent,"That's it, the end."
172,00:16:41,2021-06-12 10:48:44,Child,Is that the end of story time?
173,00:16:43,2021-06-12 10:48:46,Parent,[inaudible 00:16:43].
174,00:16:44,2021-06-12 10:48:47,Robot,Could you please ask us a question about Little Red Hen?
175,00:16:52,2021-06-12 10:48:55,Child,Why didn't Little Red Hen share the bread?
176,00:16:52,2021-06-12 10:48:55,Robot,What do you think?
177,00:16:53,2021-06-12 10:48:56,Child,"I- I think that because they weren't being very good friends, and they did- and they didn't help make the- make the bread. Uh."
178,00:17:13,2021-06-12 10:49:16,Parent,That's a good answer.
179,00:17:16,2021-06-12 10:49:19,Robot,"Oh, I see."
180,00:17:20,2021-06-12 10:49:23,Child,"But if I was the Little Red Hen, I would share it."
181,00:17:20,2021-06-12 10:49:23,Robot,Good reasoning.
182,00:17:20,2021-06-12 10:49:23,Child,She claps for me.
183,00:17:20,2021-06-12 10:49:23,Parent,"Okay, hit bookshelf."

189,00:18:00,2021-06-12 10:50:03,Child,"Yeah, I like it."
190,00:18:01,2021-06-12 10:50:04,Parent,"I know, it's a fun story. You ready? Okay. Rap a Tap Tap, Here's Bojangles, think of that."
191,00:18:01,2021-06-12 10:50:04,Child,I think of that being me.
192,00:18:09,2021-06-12 10:50:12,Parent,Is that you?
193,00:18:09,2021-06-12 10:50:12,Child,I'm thinking.
194,00:18:09,2021-06-12 10:50:12,Parent,Alex Bojangles?
195,00:18:10,2021-06-12 10:50:13,Child,"(laughs) Yeah. (laughs) He's, uh, he's just [inaudible 00:18:24]."
196,00:18:26,2021-06-12 10:50:29,Parent,"Okay. There was once a man who danced in the street, a rap a tap, tap, think of that."
197,00:18:26,2021-06-12 10:50:29,Child,He will get a ticket.

202,00:18:43,2021-06-12 10:50:46,Parent,"He brought pleasure to the people he'd greet, rap a tap, tap, think of that. He didn't just dance, he made art with his feet, rap a tap, tap, think of that."
203,00:18:59,2021-06-12 10:51:02,Child,Are they- how did he make art with his feet?
204,00:19:02,2021-06-12 10:51:05,Parent,He was dancing. Dance is a form of art.
205,00:19:07,2021-06-12 10:51:10,Child,I had no idea it was art.
206,00:19:09,2021-06-12 10:51:12,Parent,There's a number of things-
207,00:19:11,2021-06-12 10:51:14,Child,Martial arts?
