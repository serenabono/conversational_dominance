Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Story Time App. Let's go ahead and select the book on the app."
1,00:00:29,2021-05-22 09:00:13,Parent,"Okay, you want to [inaudible 00:00:31]? The Little Red Hen. One summer day the little red hen found a grain of wheat. ""A grain of wheat,"" said the little red hen to herself, ""I will... plant it."" She asked the duck, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. She asked the goose, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the goose. She asked the cat, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the cat. She asked the pig, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will plant it myself,"" um, said the little red hen, and she did. Soon the wheat grew tall and the hen, little red hen knew it was time to reap it. Do you know what reap it means? It means gather it or collect it for harvest, ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" she asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck, ""Quack, Quack."" ""Not I,"" said the goose, ""Honk, Honk."" ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Oink, not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will reap it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour. ""Who will help me carry, uh, the wheat to mill?"" she asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig, ""Oink, oink, oink."" ""Then I will carry it-"
2,00:02:14,2021-05-22 09:01:58,Robot,"I wonder what questions we can come up about duck, can you help me come up with one?"
3,00:02:21,2021-05-22 09:02:05,Parent,"Do you want to come up with a question? Not now please. ""Then I will carry it myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did, she carried the wheat to the mill and the miller made it into flour. When she got at home she asked, ""Who will help me make the flour into dough?"" Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will make the dough myself,"" and the little red hen did, and she did, and it, soon the bread was ready to go in the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" she said the little red hen. Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will bake it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. After the loaf had been taken from the oven it was set on the windowsill to cool. ""And now,"" said the little red hen, ""Who will help me eat the bread?"" ""I will,"" said the duck. ""I will,"" said the goose. ""I wile,"" said the cat. ""Oink, oink, I will,"" said the pig. ""No, I will eat myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did. What do you think?"
4,00:03:30,2021-05-22 09:03:14,Robot,"Perhaps it's a good time for us to talk about little red hen. Margaret, do you want to start a chat?"
5,00:03:36,2021-05-22 09:03:20,Parent,"Yes, let's chat. Do you think the little red hen was fair to not give them any bread?"
6,00:03:47,2021-05-22 09:03:31,Child,Yes.
7,00:03:48,2021-05-22 09:03:32,Parent,Why?
8,00:03:49,2021-05-22 09:03:33,Child,'Cause they didn't help her.
9,00:03:52,2021-05-22 09:03:36,Parent,Were they supposed to help her if they wanted to share some?
10,00:03:56,2021-05-22 09:03:40,Child,Yes.
11,00:03:57,2021-05-22 09:03:41,Parent,"I think so too. What do you think, Jibo, it, was it fair?"
12,00:04:04,2021-05-22 09:03:48,Robot,Great.
13,00:04:06,2021-05-22 09:03:50,Parent,"Great. It was great great. So I think he think that means fair. You want to read Geraldine, The Music Mouse or something else today? You choose."
14,00:04:13,2021-05-22 09:03:57,Child,Something else.
15,00:04:21,2021-05-22 09:04:05,Parent,"Um, A Year At The Maple Farm or The Three Little Pigs? You can read Fall, Spring or Summer or click more books, maybe winter. (laughs) or maybe that way. Those are our choices. The Little Pigs?"
16,00:04:44,2021-05-22 09:04:28,Child,Spring.
17,00:04:45,2021-05-22 09:04:29,Parent,Spring? Are you reading it this time please?
18,00:04:47,2021-05-22 09:04:31,Child,"No, you."
19,00:04:48,2021-05-22 09:04:32,Parent,"Why? It's not fair if one person does all the work TiTi (laughing). It's not fair is everyone does all the work. Jibo, what are you looking at? Jibo, you silly [inaudible 00:04:58] you're looking at ceiling."
20,00:05:03,2021-05-22 09:04:47,Child,(laughs)
21,00:05:04,2021-05-22 09:04:48,Parent,"He's so silly. Okay, The Year At The Maple Hill Farm, Spring. This is a book about farm animals and what happens during one year on a farm. The year is divided into 12 months, the months are divided into..."
22,00:05:22,2021-05-22 09:05:06,Child,Weeks.
23,00:05:22,2021-05-22 09:05:06,Parent,And the weeks are into...
24,00:05:26,2021-05-22 09:05:10,Child,Days.

28,00:05:31,2021-05-22 09:05:15,Child,Minute.
29,00:05:33,2021-05-22 09:05:17,Parent,"Animals don't know there is such a thing as a year but they know about seasons. Animals know when the cold will come they grow heavy coats. They know when it is summer and they shed them... that means they lose their fur, their heavy fur. When it is hot they look for shade and in winter they look for shelter. People have names for what they call the months of the year. We could start with many, any month as far as the animals and concerned, but it's usual to begin January. That's when we start the year, right TiTi?"
30,00:06:05,2021-05-22 09:05:49,Child,"January, February, [inaudible 00:06:07] April, May, June, July, August? (laughing)"
31,00:06:13,2021-05-22 09:05:57,Parent,I don't know what... that's silly Jibo's doing. January is a... What does it say? Spring months?
32,00:06:13,2021-05-22 09:05:57,Child,Winter.
33,00:06:22,2021-05-22 09:06:06,Parent,Winter month. The ground is covered with...
34,00:06:25,2021-05-22 09:06:09,Child,Snow.
35,00:06:28,2021-05-22 09:06:12,Parent,"Cows stay in the barnyard when the ground is frozen and so do the chickens, uh, but not many la- are, eggs are laid in January. The days are-"
36,00:06:38,2021-05-22 09:06:22,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up here.
37,00:06:43,2021-05-22 09:06:27,Child,[inaudible 00:06:43].
38,00:06:44,2021-05-22 09:06:28,Parent,"Jibo, do you like chickens? Do you-"
39,00:06:50,2021-05-22 09:06:34,Robot,Sort of.
40,00:06:52,2021-05-22 09:06:36,Parent,You sort of like chickens?
41,00:06:55,2021-05-22 09:06:39,Child,"Hey, Jibo, do you like cows?"
42,00:07:00,2021-05-22 09:06:44,Robot,[inaudible 00:07:00] do you like chickens?
43,00:07:05,2021-05-22 09:06:49,Child,Yes.
44,00:07:05,2021-05-22 09:06:49,Robot,Yes.
45,00:07:07,2021-05-22 09:06:51,Parent,Yes you like cows? Um-
46,00:07:13,2021-05-22 09:06:57,Robot,H-M-M.
47,00:07:16,2021-05-22 09:07:00,Parent,H- that's hmm. Hmm...
48,00:07:19,2021-05-22 09:07:03,Robot,Not so sure.
49,00:07:21,2021-05-22 09:07:05,Parent,Yeah.
50,00:07:26,2021-05-22 09:07:10,Child,M-O-O-E?
51,00:07:27,2021-05-22 09:07:11,Parent,"M-O-O, do you know what that one means Jibo? Moo. (laughing)"
52,00:07:27,2021-05-22 09:07:11,Child,(laughs)
53,00:07:33,2021-05-22 09:07:17,Parent,"Jibo, do you know how it takes a chick to be born from an egg? Don't pick your nose TiTi, yucky, we can get you a Kleenex if you need one but don't pick it. Do you know how long it takes a chick to be born from an egg?"
54,00:07:47,2021-05-22 09:07:31,Robot,"I don't know, do you know?"
55,00:07:50,2021-05-22 09:07:34,Parent,"You know how long it takes a chick to be born from an egg, [Thea 00:07:52]?"
56,00:07:52,2021-05-22 09:07:36,Child,21 days.
57,00:07:55,2021-05-22 09:07:39,Parent,"21 days, that's right."
58,00:07:58,2021-05-22 09:07:42,Robot,Wow.
59,00:08:00,2021-05-22 09:07:44,Child,(laughs)
60,00:08:01,2021-05-22 09:07:45,Parent,"Um, should we keep going now with the story guys?"
61,00:08:08,2021-05-22 09:07:52,Child,Yeah-
62,00:08:08,2021-05-22 09:07:52,Parent,"Or you just wanna play? The days are too short and dark. The horses don't mind the cold, neither do the sheep with their heavy winter coats. It is a col, gray time of year and night falls early. All the farm animals stay close to the barn where they are being fed. There is hay and grain to eat, even the wild deer come near the farm hoping to find a little salt or windfall apple under the snow. Febru- oh, what follows January?"
63,00:08:08,2021-05-22 09:07:52,Child,February.
64,00:08:39,2021-05-22 09:08:23,Parent,"February follows January, the forest pond is frozen solid, all but a marshy place where the spring water feed a pond. The children are having a skating party. When they are cold they sit by the fire and toast their toes and noses. The geese play in the water all winter, you think their bare feet would freeze but they never do. The noisy rooks are having a circus. This black bird's called a rook. They toss and tumble on the trapezes of bare branches. Rooks like winter. Under the ice in a tunnel in the frozen ground the winter rat is napping, he won't be up until spring. March is a windy month, it is still cold outside but you can tell spring is coming. There are signs of spring in the barn. The pony has given birth to a foal, she loves him and looks after him. The milk cow has..."
65,00:09:37,2021-05-22 09:09:21,Child,A new calf.
66,00:09:42,2021-05-22 09:09:26,Parent,Okay. She...
67,00:09:43,2021-05-22 09:09:27,Child,Loves him.
68,00:09:45,2021-05-22 09:09:29,Parent,"And gives him her milk. The good, gray barn cat has her litter of..."
69,00:09:51,2021-05-22 09:09:35,Child,Kittens.
70,00:09:54,2021-05-22 09:09:38,Parent,"In the hay rack. I'm, oh, do you see the barn cat? Oh, it's up there. The mother ewe... That's a funny word, right? That's a girl sheep... has two new..."
71,00:10:07,2021-05-22 09:09:51,Child,Lambs.
72,00:10:07,2021-05-22 09:09:51,Parent,The nanny goat has a new...
73,00:10:09,2021-05-22 09:09:53,Child,Kid.
74,00:10:12,2021-05-22 09:09:56,Parent,"Too. All the animal mothers are proud and protective and full of love. Awe. You wanna tell me about March, weather girl? March is? Too silly. March is windey?"
75,00:10:30,2021-05-22 09:10:14,Child,(laughs)
76,00:10:33,2021-05-22 09:10:17,Parent,Is it windey?
77,00:10:33,2021-05-22 09:10:17,Child,Wind.
78,00:10:35,2021-05-22 09:10:19,Parent,"Oh, March is windy and rainy, but when the sun does shine it shines more brightly and the days are longer. There are signs of spring everywhere. The robins are back and are busy building their nests. A wild duck is in the marsh marigolds. Where is the wild duck in the marsh marigolds? The rooster wakes everyone early in the morning. What does he say?"
79,00:11:01,2021-05-22 09:10:45,Child,Cock-a-doodle-do.
80,00:11:05,2021-05-22 09:10:49,Parent,"The geese... A- aye, Jibo, can you make a rooster noise?"
81,00:11:07,2021-05-22 09:10:51,Child,"Hey, Jibo."
82,00:11:11,2021-05-22 09:10:55,Parent,Can you crow like a ro- rooster? Maybe he can't.
83,00:11:11,2021-05-22 09:10:55,Robot,Sorry.
84,00:11:11,2021-05-22 09:10:55,Child,Cock-a-doodle-do.
85,00:11:12,2021-05-22 09:10:56,Parent,That's a rooster noise-
86,00:11:12,2021-05-22 09:10:56,Robot,I know [inaudible 00:11:22].
87,00:11:12,2021-05-22 09:10:56,Child,Cock-a-doodle-do.
88,00:11:12,2021-05-22 09:10:56,Parent,(laughs)
89,00:11:35,2021-05-22 09:11:19,Robot,I like it.
90,00:11:35,2021-05-22 09:11:19,Parent,"Oh, I'm glad you like it. The rooster wakes everyone earlier in the morning, the geese are cranky, they must have laid an egg. The meadow mice are out looking around. The mad, march hare is hurrying in all directions, the ice on the pond has melted and there are pussy willows. These are pussy willows, those little, little, uh, little soft little bunny tails it looks like. The horses have found a little grass under the last patches of snow [crosstalk 00:12:02], they lie down in the pale sunshine, you don't see that often if the ground is frozen. What is the next month TiTi?"
91,00:12:11,2021-05-22 09:11:55,Child,April.
92,00:12:11,2021-05-22 09:11:55,Parent,April is a...
93,00:12:12,2021-05-22 09:11:56,Child,Spring month.
94,00:12:15,2021-05-22 09:11:59,Parent,You... you can tell that is st- spring here by all the...
95,00:12:20,2021-05-22 09:12:04,Child,Egg.
96,00:12:22,2021-05-22 09:12:06,Parent,Tell me about this.
97,00:12:24,2021-05-22 09:12:08,Child,Egg.
98,00:12:25,2021-05-22 09:12:09,Parent,"Eggs in the barn, in the fields, in the trees, under the caves, everywhere. Why do they have caves in their farm? The good ole brown hen has been busy sitting on eggs for..."
99,00:12:36,2021-05-22 09:12:20,Child,For 21 days.
100,00:12:41,2021-05-22 09:12:25,Parent,"Now... now, what happens? Her... TiTi, what does it say? TiTi? Now her baby chicks are..."
101,00:12:51,2021-05-22 09:12:35,Child,Hatch.
102,00:12:52,2021-05-22 09:12:36,Parent,"Hatching. It must be hard to pick your way out of an egg, but the chicks are fluffy and, uh, pretty and fluffy in no time."
103,00:13:02,2021-05-22 09:12:46,Robot,Maybe we can talk about hatching.
104,00:13:06,2021-05-22 09:12:50,Parent,"Yeah, what do you want to say about hatching TiTi? Have you seen baby chicks hatch out of eggs?"
105,00:13:06,2021-05-22 09:12:50,Child,Yes.
106,00:13:14,2021-05-22 09:12:58,Parent,"Yes, and when they come out are they wet or dry?"
107,00:13:20,2021-05-22 09:13:04,Child,Wet.
108,00:13:22,2021-05-22 09:13:06,Parent,do they look sticky?
109,00:13:23,2021-05-22 09:13:07,Child,Yes.
110,00:13:26,2021-05-22 09:13:10,Parent,Because why?
111,00:13:29,2021-05-22 09:13:13,Child,They are wet.
112,00:13:30,2021-05-22 09:13:14,Parent,"Well, they are wet, but they have egg yolk all over the- egg all over them, because inside the egg they were eating egg, yum, yum, yum. Then what happens?"
113,00:13:42,2021-05-22 09:13:26,Robot,Why are they sticky? I am curious?
114,00:13:45,2021-05-22 09:13:29,Parent,Because they have egg on them. But they-
115,00:13:54,2021-05-22 09:13:38,Robot,[inaudible 00:13:54].
116,00:13:54,2021-05-22 09:13:38,Parent,"... they dry off quick. We just had three baby chicks born at our house, Jibo... and the momma chicken is taking care of them."
117,00:14:12,2021-05-22 09:13:56,Robot,"Well, three babies."
118,00:14:15,2021-05-22 09:13:59,Parent,"Wow, he can really talk to us."
119,00:14:17,2021-05-22 09:14:01,Robot,Good job.
120,00:14:21,2021-05-22 09:14:05,Parent,"The robins are already hatching eggs in their business-like way. This silly goes has laid an egg in the middle of nowhere, she must be... was she..."
121,00:14:21,2021-05-22 09:14:05,Child,Crazy.
122,00:14:33,2021-05-22 09:14:17,Parent,"Crazy. This big bird is laying her egg in a little bird's nest. Do you know what that big bird is that lays her egg in a little bird's nest? It's another crazy bird. Usually it's only in Europe. You, cuckoos do that, there's a call- a bird called a cuckoo bird and they lay their eggs in another bird's nest and knock the other bird- egg, eggs out. She must be a cuckoo. This little bird is feeding her babies. I don't know, do we have... Jibo, do you know, do we have cuckoos in North America or just in Europe? Where's cuckoo bird from?"
123,00:15:23,2021-05-22 09:15:07,Robot,I don't know.
124,00:15:24,2021-05-22 09:15:08,Parent,"She must be a cuckoo. This little bird is feeding her babies, she must wonder why one baby is so big. Here is a basket of colored eggs among the flowers. I wonder what time it is TiTi. What's that look like?"
125,00:15:40,2021-05-22 09:15:24,Child,Easter?
126,00:15:41,2021-05-22 09:15:25,Parent,"Easter. No one has found it yet, dogs steal eggs when they can find them and carry them away. Perhaps dogs make nests too. Do you think dogs do that?"
127,00:15:51,2021-05-22 09:15:35,Child,(laughs) No.
128,00:15:53,2021-05-22 09:15:37,Parent,Did your dog ever try to steal an egg?
129,00:15:56,2021-05-22 09:15:40,Child,No.
130,00:15:56,2021-05-22 09:15:40,Parent,"No. Many, May... Oh, this is the next month, what's the next month?"
131,00:16:13,2021-05-22 09:15:57,Child,May.
132,00:16:13,2021-05-22 09:15:57,Parent,What's it say?
133,00:16:13,2021-05-22 09:15:57,Child,Days are...

Everyone gets a hai- haircut one way or another. Look at that, here's the sheep and they, they sheer the sheep, that means they give it a haircut and take off the wool. Do you know what you can make with wool TiTi?"

138,00:16:42,2021-05-22 09:16:26,Parent,"You can make a wool coat, sure, that's very warm. This dog will lose its fur. The wooly sheep are shorn, the black sheepdog is shorn at the same time, not a very fancy clip. She will scarcely be recognizable without her long curls but they will grow back in time for winter and she will look herself again. Aw, look [inaudible 00:17:09] (laughs). Even the chicken molt, the rooster won't be himself until he can parade his fine tail feathers again. Look at that, the chickens are losing their furs. Look at the, look so silly. Even though it's cool and comfortable it must be embarrassing to lose all your clothes all at once. Cats don't need clipping, they shed their coats on other people's clothes and furniture. Cats.
