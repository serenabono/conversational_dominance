0,00:00:00,2021-06-04 16:33:16,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:00,2021-06-04 16:33:16,Child,Hello.
2,00:00:04,2021-06-04 16:33:20,Robot,"I am now on Storytime mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Storytime app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
3,00:00:35,2021-06-04 16:33:51,Child,"I want to read this one. Wait, I didn't want that one. I wanted this one."
4,00:01:01,2021-06-04 16:34:17,Parent,"The rooster crows and struts. He's got feathers. He's got guts. Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows. The cow makes milk, standing, grazing. Abracadabra, she's utterly amazing. The pony whinnies in the wind, kicks in his stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall. The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shady farmhouse yard. You might think he's keeping cool. Beware, he's keeping guard. The sheep began his wooly life as gentle as a lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram."
5,00:01:58,2021-06-04 16:35:14,Robot,What is a ram?
6,00:02:09,2021-06-04 16:35:25,Child,It's a goat that has horns.
7,00:02:09,2021-06-04 16:35:25,Robot,Wonderful.
8,00:02:09,2021-06-04 16:35:25,Parent,"Bam! Like bam, right? With the barn cat, mice had better thing twice. the goat eats everything from trash to trillion. Hey, look out, he'll knock you silly. When he's bad, we call him William. When he's good, he's just our Billy. The pig, her tail as coy as a ringlet. In her eyes there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow. I see a beauty queen. The snake coils in the garden like a spring or the wild and winding melody he hears but cannot sing. The bees tell their story, sweet and old, it begins in clover, it ends with gold. The bull knows what he likes, cows and corn. Knows what he is, muscle and horn."
9,00:03:18,2021-06-04 16:36:34,Robot,Can you point to the bull's horn?
10,00:03:22,2021-06-04 16:36:38,Parent,"Need to click on it. The turtle lifts her fossil head and blinks, one, two, three times in the awful light. In her house it's always night. The duck quacks, the hen squawks, the goose honks. But the rabbit listens, listens, listens, and doesn't make a sound. The end. Stop touching your face."
11,00:04:10,2021-06-04 16:37:26,Robot,That was a great story. Want to read another one?
12,00:04:18,2021-06-04 16:37:34,Parent,Paul? You don't want to read any of The Three Little Pigs? I'm surprised. [crosstalk 00:04:25] Three Little Pigs? Three Little Pigs?
13,00:04:27,2021-06-04 16:37:43,Child,"Well, yeah, we've seen that."
14,00:04:35,2021-06-04 16:37:51,Parent,"The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time, an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write"" she said. ""And remember that I love you."" The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea"" said the man. ""Mind your own business, thank you"" said the little pig. And he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all. Very soon a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door and said ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in, and he gobbled up the little pig. The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that"" said the man."
15,00:06:16,2021-06-04 16:39:32,Robot,Did the little pig believe the wolf could blow away his house?
16,00:06:22,2021-06-04 16:39:38,Child,No.
17,00:06:28,2021-06-04 16:39:44,Robot,Why?
18,00:06:31,2021-06-04 16:39:47,Child,"Because he thinked it was so strong, the house that he made."
19,00:06:48,2021-06-04 16:40:04,Parent,"The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that"" said the man. ""Well, poo"" said the little pig. ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty"" he said. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all and he said ""I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha, ha, ha"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in, and he gobbled up the little pig. Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine sturdy house"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow"" said the little pig."
20,00:08:03,2021-06-04 16:41:19,Robot,What can make a nice strong house?
21,00:08:09,2021-06-04 16:41:25,Child,Bricks.
22,00:08:09,2021-06-04 16:41:25,Robot,Thank you.
23,00:08:11,2021-06-04 16:41:27,Parent,"So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in than he noticed the wolf loitering about, and the wolf who was still hungry said ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" Well, the wolf had heard that before, and he said ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Don't do that"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. I'll try another approach muttered the wolf."
24,00:09:12,2021-06-04 16:42:28,Robot,"When you mutter, how do you feel?"
25,00:09:14,2021-06-04 16:42:30,Child,Hm?
26,00:09:17,2021-06-04 16:42:33,Parent,"When you mutter, you see right here? The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach"" muttered the wolf. How do you feel when you mutter?"
27,00:09:30,2021-06-04 16:42:46,Child,Not so good.
28,00:09:33,2021-06-04 16:42:49,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Frustrated? Angry?
29,00:09:33,2021-06-04 16:42:49,Child,Frustrated and angry.
30,00:09:36,2021-06-04 16:42:52,Robot,Good job.
31,00:09:41,2021-06-04 16:42:57,Parent,"And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""Little pig, I was only teasing"" he said. ""By the way, I hear tell that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shell we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now"" said the little pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at 6."" The next morning the little pig got up at 5, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basketful of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6, the turmi, turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done"" he said. ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree down in Merry Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few applies?"" ""I must cook my turnips"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say at 5?"" The next morning, the little pig was up at 4 and went off for the applies. It took longer than he had expected to reach Merry Meadow, and while busy gathering applies in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go a faire? To go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there"" said the little pig. ""Would 3 o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal"" said the wolf. ""Three it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at 2."
32,00:11:59,2021-06-04 16:45:15,Robot,"Jenny, why did the little pig ask would 3 o'clock suit you?"
33,00:12:06,2021-06-04 16:45:22,Parent,"Um, because he wanted to go earlier."
34,00:12:16,2021-06-04 16:45:32,Robot,Why?
35,00:12:18,2021-06-04 16:45:34,Parent,"Why? Because he usually asked for a time and he goes one hour earlier. Have you noticed that? At 1 in the ma, afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time. So fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" said the little pig. ""That great round thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron put in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come"" cried the wolf. ""Dinnertime."""
36,00:13:48,2021-06-04 16:47:04,Robot,Why did the wolf think he could eat the little pig now?
37,00:13:52,2021-06-04 16:47:08,Child,"Because he wanted, he, it was too much for him, to eat him."
38,00:14:02,2021-06-04 16:47:18,Robot,Thank you.
39,00:14:04,2021-06-04 16:47:20,Parent,"""You can say that again"" said the little pig. And he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up. The end."
40,00:14:24,2021-06-04 16:47:40,Child,Hm.
41,00:14:26,2021-06-04 16:47:42,Robot,Thank you for the story. Maybe a short one.
42,00:14:29,2021-06-04 16:47:45,Parent,"Short one. This is the wrong name, you're supposed to put in... This first one here. Okay, pick one. Okay. Chicka chicka boom boom. Again? A told B, and B told C, “I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree.” “Whee!” said D to E, F, G. “I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree.” Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Here comes H up the coconut tree, and I and J and tag-along K, all on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Look who’s coming! L, M, N, O, P! And Q, R, S! And T, U, V! Still more, W! And X, Y, Z! The whole alphabet up the... Oh, no!"
43,00:15:40,2021-06-04 16:48:56,Robot,"Oh no, what will happen to all the letters in the tree?"
44,00:15:43,2021-06-04 16:48:59,Child,They'll all fall.
45,00:15:47,2021-06-04 16:49:03,Robot,Wonderful.
46,00:15:49,2021-06-04 16:49:05,Parent,"Chicka chicka BOOM! BOOM! Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree. Mamas and papas and uncles and aunts hug their little dears, then dust their pants. ""Help us up,"" cried A B C. Next from the pileup skinned-knee D and stubbed-toe E and patched-up F. Then comes G all out of breath. H is tangled up with I. J, and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie. M is looped. N is stopped. O is twisted alley-oop. Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Look who's coming! It's black-eyed P, Q, R, S, and loose-tooth T. Then U, V, W wiggle-jiggle free. Last to come X, Y, Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree... But,  chicka chicka boom boom! Look, there's a full moon. A is out of bed, and this is what he said, ""Dare double dare, you can't catch me. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka chicka BOOM! BOOM!"
47,00:17:19,2021-06-04 16:50:35,Robot,"Hey, Jenny. Why do you think the letters want to go back up the tree?"
48,00:17:24,2021-06-04 16:50:40,Parent,It's fun. Okay. What do you want to do? Do you wanna do one more? Or you think we're done with this?
49,00:17:24,2021-06-04 16:50:40,Child,Yeah.
50,00:17:46,2021-06-04 16:51:02,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
51,00:17:59,2021-06-04 16:51:15,Parent,Say bye Jibo.
52,00:18:00,2021-06-04 16:51:16,Robot,"Please give me a few minutes to rest. I will switch back to ledger mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey and..."
