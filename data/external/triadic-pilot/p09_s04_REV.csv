10,00:00:34,2021-06-15 19:41:06,Child,What does that mean?
11,00:00:34,2021-06-15 19:41:06,Parent,"Like um, do you want to ask Jibo what proactive means?"
12,00:00:35,2021-06-15 19:41:07,Child,"Jibo, what does proactive mean?"
13,00:00:42,2021-06-15 19:41:14,Robot,Very active.
14,00:00:44,2021-06-15 19:41:16,Parent,Hm. So is Jibo going to be active?
15,00:00:46,2021-06-15 19:41:18,Child,No.
16,00:00:47,2021-06-15 19:41:19,Parent,"But if you wanted to ask Jibo a question, you can."

32,00:02:55,2021-06-15 19:43:27,Parent,"Aw, that's cool. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Listen, do you want to pick another book if it's a long one?"
33,00:02:57,2021-06-15 19:43:29,Child,"My Five Senses. Wait, Jibo didn't even know."
34,00:03:02,2021-06-15 19:43:34,Parent,"Gonna tell Jibo? Say, ""I finished the book,"""

39,00:03:17,2021-06-15 19:43:49,Robot,I loved the story.
40,00:03:20,2021-06-15 19:43:52,Child,Good. I can see with my eyes.
41,00:03:22,2021-06-15 19:43:54,Robot,Maybe one more?
42,00:03:25,2021-06-15 19:43:57,Child,Yeah. Let me- let me do. I can hear with my ears. I can smell with my nose. I can taste with my tongue. I can touch with my fingers. I do all this with my senses. My five senses. When I- when I see the sun or a frog. When my baby sister [inaudible 00:03:53] me to play [inaudible 00:03:56]. When I hear violin through [inaudible 00:04:02] my sense of hearing [inaudible 00:04:04]. When I smell soap or pine or I- or I- or I smell soap or pine or cookies.
43,00:03:25,2021-06-15 19:43:57,Robot,Or a pine tree.
44,00:04:21,2021-06-15 19:44:53,Child,"Or a pine tree or cookies, [inaudible 00:04:22] I use my sense of smell. I am smelling. When I drink my milk and I eat my food, I use my sense of taste. I am tasting. When I touch little kitten [inaudible 00:04:39] or a bowl of water, I use my sense of touch. I am touching. Sometimes I use all senses at once. Sometimes I only use one. Often I play a game with myself [inaudible 00:04:58] sensing [inaudible 00:04:59] at that. I [inaudible 00:05:01] sensing [inaudible 00:05:03] at that time. When I look at the moon and the stars I use my s- I am seeing. When I often play with my puppy I use four senses. I see, hear, smell and touch. And see. See?"
45,00:05:25,2021-06-15 19:45:57,Parent,Ooh. That's right.
46,00:05:26,2021-06-15 19:45:58,Child,"And when I bounce ball, I use three senses. I see, I hear, I touch. Sometimes I use m- more of one sense, and less of another. But each sense is very important to me because it makes me aware. To be aware it is to see all there is to see. Hear all there is to hear. And smell all there's- there is to smell. And taste all there (laughs) is to taste."
47,00:06:05,2021-06-15 19:46:37,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative). (laughs)
48,00:06:09,2021-06-15 19:46:41,Child,"Touch all there is to touch. Whenever- wherever I go, whatever I do, and at every minute of the day, my senses are keeping- they make me [inaudible 00:06:21]. The end."

51,00:06:29,2021-06-15 19:47:01,Robot,Want to read another one?
52,00:06:29,2021-06-15 19:47:01,Parent,"Sh, sh, sh, sh. It's okay, puppy. It's okay."
53,00:06:39,2021-06-15 19:47:11,Child,"Have you read On the Farm, mom?"
54,00:06:53,2021-06-15 19:47:25,Parent,Do you want to? I haven't read that one yet.
55,00:06:53,2021-06-15 19:47:25,Child,This one.
56,00:06:53,2021-06-15 19:47:25,Parent,"Hey, come here."
57,00:06:53,2021-06-15 19:47:25,Child,Can you read this one?
58,00:06:53,2021-06-15 19:47:25,Parent,Sure.
59,00:06:54,2021-06-15 19:47:26,Child,[inaudible 00:06:54].

61,00:06:54,2021-06-15 19:47:26,Child,"Oh, yeah."
62,00:06:54,2021-06-15 19:47:26,Parent,Yeah. Do you want to find one that we haven't read yet?
63,00:06:55,2021-06-15 19:47:27,Child,We've read all the short ones.
64,00:06:57,2021-06-15 19:47:29,Parent,"Have we read... Oh, we have read all the short books. Should we try one of the long books?"
65,00:07:02,2021-06-15 19:47:34,Child,No.
66,00:07:03,2021-06-15 19:47:35,Parent,I can read it.
67,00:07:03,2021-06-15 19:47:35,Child,No.
68,00:07:03,2021-06-15 19:47:35,Parent,Let's see.
69,00:07:03,2021-06-15 19:47:35,Child,"Um, Mom."
70,00:07:04,2021-06-15 19:47:36,Parent,'Cause that way we can have all of the stories read.
71,00:07:08,2021-06-15 19:47:40,Child,We- we only have to do- we only have to do two.
72,00:07:08,2021-06-15 19:47:40,Parent,Well let's try this one.
73,00:07:14,2021-06-15 19:47:46,Child,I- I really don't want to do three.
74,00:07:15,2021-06-15 19:47:47,Parent,You don't want to do three?
75,00:07:19,2021-06-15 19:47:51,Child,"Um, tell me [inaudible 00:07:19]."
76,00:07:19,2021-06-15 19:47:51,Parent,But have you done the Three Billy Goat's Gruff? That happens to be your dad's favorite folk tale.
77,00:07:23,2021-06-15 19:47:55,Child,"I think I've read it. Yeah, I've read it. I've read it before."
78,00:07:26,2021-06-15 19:47:58,Parent,That one? They have different versions.
79,00:07:39,2021-06-15 19:48:11,Child,"Maybe. Can you just read it? Oh, let's just read it."
80,00:07:39,2021-06-15 19:48:11,Parent,"Oh, okay. The Three Billy Goat's Gruff. Retold by Mary Finch, illustrated by Robetta- Roberta Arenson, narrated by Richard Hope."
81,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Child,Why does it say retold?
82,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Parent,Oh. Ask Jibo that. Yeah [inaudible 00:07:59].
83,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Child,I- I'm kidding. I know it.
84,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Parent,"Let Jibo- What does it mean? Okay, you better not [crosstalk 00:08:00]-"
85,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Child,"Mom, [inaudible 00:08:00]."
86,00:07:59,2021-06-15 19:48:31,Parent,"Uh-uh. There's a reason. And if Jibo doesn't know, I can tell you. Go ahead and ask Jibo."
87,00:08:07,2021-06-15 19:48:39,Child,Jibo? What does retold mean?
88,00:08:15,2021-06-15 19:48:47,Robot,Sorry?
89,00:08:16,2021-06-15 19:48:48,Parent,"So- so the Three Billy Goat's Gruff isn't by Mary Finch, it's retold by Mary Finch. And Luke is wondering why it says retold by."
90,00:08:37,2021-06-15 19:49:09,Robot,"Oh, sorry. I don't know."
91,00:08:40,2021-06-15 19:49:12,Parent,"Okay, so it's... What was your idea?"
92,00:08:49,2021-06-15 19:49:21,Child,"Um, what, or they're- it's basically a book-"
93,00:08:49,2021-06-15 19:49:21,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
94,00:08:49,2021-06-15 19:49:21,Child,And it was a book. And-
95,00:08:54,2021-06-15 19:49:26,Parent,Or maybe it was a story without a book.
96,00:08:54,2021-06-15 19:49:26,Child,Yeah.
97,00:08:57,2021-06-15 19:49:29,Parent,Maybe it was just a story that was told.
98,00:08:58,2021-06-15 19:49:30,Child,Yeah. And then she made it into a book.
99,00:08:58,2021-06-15 19:49:30,Parent,That's right.
100,00:09:06,2021-06-15 19:49:38,Child,Can I [inaudible 00:09:06]-
101,00:09:06,2021-06-15 19:49:38,Parent,"Once upon a time, there were three Billy Goats Gruff. There was little Billy Goat Gruff, a middle sized Billy Goat Gruff, and a big Billy Goat Gruff. The three Billy Goats Gruff lived in a field and they spend their days munching the green grass. On one side of the field there was a stream and over the stream there was a rickety bridge. On the other side of the rickety bridge, there was a hill. And there, the grass grew greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the Billy Goats Gruff. Under the rickety bridge lived a big, hairy troll and a deep, dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge and that made the troll furious."
102,00:09:44,2021-06-15 19:50:16,Child,[inaudible 00:09:44].
103,00:09:44,2021-06-15 19:50:16,Parent,Oh.
104,00:09:50,2021-06-15 19:50:22,Child,'Cause it needs to [inaudible 00:09:52]. And if [inaudible 00:09:54].
105,00:09:54,2021-06-15 19:50:26,Parent,"Yeah. He was also hungry. One day, the little Billy Goat Gruff looked up and saw that the grass up on the hill on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow big and fat."" So trip, trap, trip, trap went the hooves of the little Billy Goat Gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. The big, hairy troll woke up with a start. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" He roared. ""I am."" Said the little- little Billy Goat Gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh, no you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a-"""
106,00:10:40,2021-06-15 19:51:12,Child,[inaudible 00:10:40].

""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little Billy b- Goat Gruff. ""I'm only small, I wouldn't make much of the mouthful. Wait for my brother. He's much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the middle size Billy Goat Gruff looked up and he too saw that the green on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip, trap, trip, trap and- went the hooves of the middle sized Billy Goat Gruff as he started across the rickety bridge. """"Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am."" Said the middle sized Billy Goat Gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream- stream."" ""Oh, no you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the middle sized Billy Goat Gruff. ""I'm not very big. I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother. He's much, much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side."
108,00:12:10,2021-06-15 19:52:42,Child,[inaudible 00:12:10].
109,00:12:10,2021-06-15 19:52:42,Parent,"Just then, the big Billy Goat Gruff looked up and he too saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet.

My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" The big Billy Goat Gruff stopped. His knees shook. His hooves trampled. Clickety clack, clickety clack on the rickety bridge. Then he pulled himself together. ""I don't think you will."" He said. And he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. Then the big Billy Goat Gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big, hairy troll, I'm happy to say that he was never seen again."
110,00:13:27,2021-06-15 19:53:59,Child,Thanks to the big Billy Goat Gruff.
111,00:13:27,2021-06-15 19:53:59,Parent,That's right. The end.
