Rap a tappa tap, think of that! He danced rain or shine in all kinds of weather. Rap a tappa tap, think of that! People listened each day for his toe tapping clatter. Rap a tappa tap, think of that! He danced many rhythms that were seldom the same. Rap a tappa tap, think of that! Dance was his passion and it brought him fame. Rap a tappa tap, think of that! It's in a movie.

Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows. The cow makes milk standing grazing. Abracadabra, she's udderly amazing. Do you know that there's a part of a cow called an udder? This part here where the milk comes out is called an udder. That's why [inaudible 00:09:00] utterly and this is udderly with a dah, dah, dah. This is a tah, tah, tah. She's udderly amazing. The pony whinnies in the wind, kicks in the stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall. So his cousin is who? Who's his cousin, [Tee-Tee 00:09:24]?"
49,00:08:16,2021-05-18 08:05:06,Child,A horse.
50,00:09:27,2021-05-18 08:06:17,Parent,Yeah. A pony's kinda like a different kind of cousin. Who's that?
51,00:09:29,2021-05-18 08:06:19,Child,A dog.
52,00:09:31,2021-05-18 08:06:21,Parent,"The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shady farmhouse yard. You might think he's keeping cool. Beware, he's keeping guard. That's right. He will just jump up and bark at someone. The sheep began his wooly life as a gentle lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram. Bam! You know what a ram is? Do you know what the ram is?"
53,00:09:31,2021-05-18 08:06:21,Child,Uh-huh (affirmative).
54,00:09:59,2021-05-18 08:06:49,Parent,What's a ram?

When he's bad we call him William. When he's good we just, he's just our Billy. You say billy goat. Or you can say silly billy. The pig. Her tail is coy as a ringlet. In her eye there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow. I see a beauty queen. Do you know what a sow is? It's a girl pig. The mama pig is called a sow. The snake coils in the garden like a spring, or the wild and winding melody he hears but cannot sing. The bees tell their stories sweet and old. It begins in clover, it ends with gold. What's the gold that their story ends with, Tee-Tee? What? No, what do bees make? They go to clover and get the pollen, and then what do they do with it?"
61,00:11:28,2021-05-18 08:08:18,Child,Make honey.
62,00:11:29,2021-05-18 08:08:19,Parent,"They all make honey, that's right. The bull knows what he likes, cows and corn. Knows what he is, muscle and horn. He likes cows and corn didn't he? The turtle lifts her fossil head and blinks, one, two, three times in the awful light. In her house it's always night. Where's her house, Tee-Tee? Her shell. Yeah, yeah. These are kinda riddle poems, huh? The duck quacks, the hen squawks, the goose honks. What? It... But the rabbit listens, listens, listens and doesn't make a sound. The end."
63,00:11:29,2021-05-18 08:08:19,Child,Click.
64,00:12:29,2021-05-18 08:09:19,Parent,"Click. You wanna do another one? Uh, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, Farm Animals, uh, My Five Senses or another My Five Senses? Do you want any of those? What do you think, Tee-Tee? You choose one. Or do you want to go into the long books?"
65,00:12:57,2021-05-18 08:09:47,Child,Yeah.
66,00:12:57,2021-05-18 08:09:47,Parent,"Let's see the long books. Long story. Let's see how long the long stories are. Okay. Geraldine, The Music Mouse, The Little Red Hen, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, uh, pooh-pooh, uh, it's another Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Little Red Hen. So there's two Little Red Hens and two Three Billy Goats Gruffs, The Year at Maple Hill Farm, The Three Little Pigs. So these are fall, spring and summer, and another, uh, Three Little Pigs. Choose one of those."
67,00:13:32,2021-05-18 08:10:22,Child,The Billy Goats Gruff.
68,00:13:36,2021-05-18 08:10:26,Parent,"Mm. Do you know this story? The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Once upon a time there were three billy goats. They lived in a valley, and the name of all three billy goats was Gruff. Maybe that's their last name. Like brothers sometimes have the same last name. There was very little grass in the valley, and the billy goats were hungry. They wanted to go up the hillside to a fine meadow full of grass and daisies where they could eat and eat and eat and eat and get fat. But on the way up there was a bridge over a rushing river, and under the bridge lived a troll who was as mean and as ugly as can be. Can you even see the troll? It's kinda camouflaged. Oh, there he is. First the youngest billy goat Gruff decided to cross the bridge. Trip trap, trip trap went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the tiniest billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat in his very small voice. ""And I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat."" ""No you're not,"" said the troll. ""And I'm coming to gobble you up!"" ""Oh, please don't take me. I'm too little [inaudible 00:14:55] I am,"" said the billy goat. ""Wait till the second billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."" ""Well, then be off with you,"" said the troll. A little later the second billy goat Gruff to cross the bridge. Trip trap, trip trap, trap. Trip trap, trip trap, trip trap went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the second billy goat Gruff, and I'm going up to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the billy goat. And his voice was not so small. ""No you're not,"" said the troll. ""For I'm coming to gobble you up."" ""Oh, please don't take me. Wait a little till the third billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."" ""Very well. Be off with you,"" said the troll. Then up came the third billy goat Gruff. Trip trap, trip trap, trip trap, trip trap went the bridge. The third billy goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" roared the troll. ""It is I, the big billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat. And his voice was as loud as the troll's. ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up,"" roared the troll. ""Well, come along,"" said the big billy goat Gruff. ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do."" Oh, what do you think is gonna happen? Uh-oh. So up come that mean and ugly troll, and the big billy goat Gruff butted him with his horns and he tramped him with his hard hooves, and he tossed him over the [inaudible 00:16:38] bridge into the rushing river. Then the big billy goat Gruff went up the hillside to join his brothers. Oh, look at him in the river. Ah! What do you think he's saying? Ah! In the meadow the three billy goats Gruff got so fat that they could hardly walk home again. They are probably there yet. So snip, snap, snout, this tale is told out."
69,00:17:00,2021-05-18 08:13:50,Child,(laughs).
70,00:17:04,2021-05-18 08:13:54,Parent,Bookshelf? Now what?

77,00:17:16,2021-05-18 08:14:06,Parent,"Okay. We'll talk to you later, Jibo."
78,00:17:18,2021-05-18 08:14:08,Robot,"I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey and sign up for the next session. Thank you. Bye-bye."
79,00:17:36,2021-05-18 08:14:26,Parent,Bye-
