0,00:00:00,2021-06-07 09:49:14,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:02,2021-06-07 09:49:16,Parent,"[inaudible 00:00:02]. Hi, Jibo."
2,00:00:04,2021-06-07 09:49:18,Robot,I am now on story-time mode.
3,00:00:07,2021-06-07 09:49:21,Parent,[crosstalk 00:00:07]
4,00:00:06,2021-06-07 09:49:20,Robot,My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording.
5,00:00:10,2021-06-07 09:49:24,Parent,Just wait a second.
6,00:00:10,2021-06-07 09:49:24,Robot,"Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story-time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
7,00:00:10,2021-06-07 09:49:24,Parent,"Want to read one of the ones we have, like The Little Red Hen?"
8,00:00:10,2021-06-07 09:49:24,Child,Hey.
9,00:00:32,2021-06-07 09:49:46,Parent,Or one of the season books?
10,00:00:33,2021-06-07 09:49:47,Child,Hey.
11,00:00:34,2021-06-07 09:49:48,Parent,"Yeah, well let ... We've read that one a lot."
12,00:00:35,2021-06-07 09:49:49,Child,Yeah. Ding-ding-ding.
13,00:00:37,2021-06-07 09:49:51,Parent,Let's pick a different one. You want to read this one again?
14,00:00:39,2021-06-07 09:49:53,Child,[inaudible 00:00:39]
15,00:00:39,2021-06-07 09:49:53,Parent,Okay.
16,00:00:39,2021-06-07 09:49:53,Child,This one. This one.
17,00:00:41,2021-06-07 09:49:55,Parent,"Okay, okay, okay. Ready?"
18,00:00:43,2021-06-07 09:49:57,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
19,00:00:45,2021-06-07 09:49:59,Parent,"Um, The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time, an old sow sent her Three Little Pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write,"" she said, ""And remember that I love you."" Aw, Momma Pig looks sad. The first Little Pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know,"" said Little Pig, ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man. ""Mind your own business, thank you,"" said the Little Pig, and he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all."
20,00:01:23,2021-06-07 09:50:37,Robot,"Why did the Little Pig say to the man, ""Mind your own business""?"
21,00:01:27,2021-06-07 09:50:41,Child,"Because the man said, ""That's not a good idea."""
22,00:01:34,2021-06-07 09:50:48,Robot,Nice.
23,00:01:38,2021-06-07 09:50:52,Parent,"So- very soon, a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world, so he knocked on the door and said, ""Little Pig, Little Pig, let me come in."" To which the Little Pig replied, ""No, no, no."""
24,00:01:53,2021-06-07 09:51:07,Child,"No, no-no, no, no, no-ney-o-no."
25,00:01:55,2021-06-07 09:51:09,Parent,"""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the Little Pig. So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the Little Pig."
26,00:02:19,2021-06-07 09:51:33,Child,(Laughs)
27,00:02:19,2021-06-07 09:51:33,Parent,"The second Little Pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said Little Pig, ""I'll buy your sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. ""Oh, poo,"" said the Little Pig, ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty,"" he said."
28,00:02:41,2021-06-07 09:51:55,Robot,Did the Little Pig believe the wolf could blow away his house?
29,00:02:45,2021-06-07 09:51:59,Child,No.
30,00:02:49,2021-06-07 09:52:03,Robot,Did the Little Pig think his house is strong?
31,00:02:53,2021-06-07 09:52:07,Child,Yes.
32,00:02:57,2021-06-07 09:52:11,Robot,Rock-o.
33,00:02:58,2021-06-07 09:52:12,Parent,Was he ready? Was the pig ready?
34,00:03:00,2021-06-07 09:52:14,Child,No.
35,00:03:02,2021-06-07 09:52:16,Parent,"No. No sooner had the Little Pig settled into his pretty house, then the wolf happened by. He was still hungry, and he said, ""Little Pig, Little Pig, let me come in."" To which the Little Pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all, and he said, ""I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha, ha, ha,"" said the Little Pig. So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the Little Pig."
36,00:03:02,2021-06-07 09:52:16,Child,(Laughs)
37,00:03:38,2021-06-07 09:52:52,Parent,"Now, the third Little Pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house"", said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the Little Pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the Little Pig, ""Nice and solid."""
38,00:04:04,2021-06-07 09:53:18,Child,I ca- I can- I can't believe that the ma- that that man could lift that load of bricks.
39,00:04:10,2021-06-07 09:53:24,Parent,"They must be very strong, huh?"
40,00:04:12,2021-06-07 09:53:26,Child,Yeah.
41,00:04:14,2021-06-07 09:53:28,Parent,"But no sooner had the Little Pig moved in, than he noticed the wolf loitering about. And the wolf, who was still hungry, said, ""Little Pig, Little Pig, let me come in."" To which the Little Pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."" Well the wolf had heard that before, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the Little Pig. But the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf."
42,00:04:57,2021-06-07 09:54:11,Robot,"When you mutter, how do you feel?"
43,00:05:03,2021-06-07 09:54:17,Child,Bad.
44,00:05:09,2021-06-07 09:54:23,Robot,"Looking at the wolf's face, his eyes look small and his eyebrows are pointing downward. What does mutter mean?"
45,00:05:17,2021-06-07 09:54:31,Child,It means like ...
46,00:05:17,2021-06-07 09:54:31,Parent,Try.
47,00:05:17,2021-06-07 09:54:31,Child,I don't know.
48,00:05:22,2021-06-07 09:54:36,Parent,"Like, speaking how? Are you happy when you're speaking?"
49,00:05:22,2021-06-07 09:54:36,Child,Uh-uh (negative).
50,00:05:25,2021-06-07 09:54:39,Parent,How are you feeling?
51,00:05:29,2021-06-07 09:54:43,Child,Mad.
52,00:05:30,2021-06-07 09:54:44,Parent,Mad and grumpy.
53,00:05:35,2021-06-07 09:54:49,Robot,Yes.
54,00:05:37,2021-06-07 09:54:51,Parent,"Good job. See? And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""Little Pig, I was only teasing,"" he said. ""By the way, I hear a tell that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now,"" said the Little Pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at six."" The next morning, the Little Pig got up at five, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basket of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at six, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. All you can pick, 10 cents. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait,"" said the Little Pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done,"" he said. ""By the way, there is a lovely apple tree down in Mary Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips,"" said the Little Pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say five?"" The next morning, the Little Pig was up at four and went off for the apples. It took longer than he'd expected to reach Mary Meadow ... and while he was busy gathering apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the Little Pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go to a fa- go ... Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" Why don't we meet there?"" said the Little Pig. ""Would three o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal,"" said the wolf. ""Three it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at two. At one in the afternoon, the Little Pig went to the fair and had a fine time. So fine, that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill."
55,00:07:48,2021-06-07 09:57:02,Robot,What does it mean that the Little Pig saw the wolf from the corner of his eye?
56,00:07:57,2021-06-07 09:57:11,Parent,It means what? He was looking what way?
57,00:07:57,2021-06-07 09:57:11,Child,Towards the house.
58,00:08:03,2021-06-07 09:57:17,Parent,What part of his eye? Was he looking straight ahead?
59,00:08:05,2021-06-07 09:57:19,Child,Sideways.
60,00:08:05,2021-06-07 09:57:19,Parent,"He was looking sideways, right?"
61,00:08:09,2021-06-07 09:57:23,Child,Yes.
62,00:08:09,2021-06-07 09:57:23,Parent,"Yeah. Um ... without a minute to spare, the Little Pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the Little Pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great brown thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" said the Little Pig. ""That great round thing was a butter churn, and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I have been nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. When the Little Pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf. ""Dinnertime."" ""You could say that again,"" said the Little Pig, and he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up. The end."
63,00:09:11,2021-06-07 09:58:25,Child,"Instead of him gobbling up the Little Pig, the pig gobbled up him."
64,00:09:21,2021-06-07 09:58:35,Parent,That's right. Do you want to go back to the bookshelf? [inaudible 00:09:30]
65,00:09:30,2021-06-07 09:58:44,Robot,That was great story. Yeah. Want to read another one?
66,00:09:35,2021-06-07 09:58:49,Parent,Do you want to read another one?
67,00:09:35,2021-06-07 09:58:49,Child,No.
68,00:09:35,2021-06-07 09:58:49,Parent,Not today?
69,00:09:41,2021-06-07 09:58:55,Child,Yeah. Not today.
70,00:09:44,2021-06-07 09:58:58,Robot,Maybe one more?
71,00:09:46,2021-06-07 09:59:00,Parent,Let's read one of the short ones.
72,00:09:47,2021-06-07 09:59:01,Child,No.
73,00:09:47,2021-06-07 09:59:01,Parent,"We'll vote ... No, let's read one of the short ones."
74,00:09:48,2021-06-07 09:59:02,Child,[inaudible 00:09:48].
75,00:09:48,2021-06-07 09:59:02,Parent,We'll make a target.
76,00:09:54,2021-06-07 09:59:08,Child,And then I can have [crosstalk 00:09:55]
77,00:09:55,2021-06-07 09:59:09,Parent,Yeah [crosstalk 00:09:55]
78,00:09:54,2021-06-07 09:59:08,Robot,One short story?
79,00:09:56,2021-06-07 09:59:10,Parent,"Yes, we'll read one short story. Which one? Do you want to read Chick- we haven't read Chicka-Chicka-Boom-Boom in a long time."
80,00:10:00,2021-06-07 09:59:14,Child,Chicka-Chicka-Boom.
81,00:10:01,2021-06-07 09:59:15,Parent,"Okay. I love this book. All right. A told B, and B told C, ""I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree."" ""Whee!"" said D to E, F, G. ""I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka-chicka-boom-boom, will there be enough room? Here comes ..."
82,00:10:29,2021-06-07 09:59:43,Child,[inaudible 00:10:29]
83,00:10:29,2021-06-07 09:59:43,Parent,"Inch up the coconut tree. And I and J and tag-along K, all on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka-chicka-boom-boom, will there be enough room? Look who's coming, it's L, M, N, O, P. And Q, R, S and T, U, V. Still more W, and X, Y, Z."
84,00:11:06,2021-06-07 10:00:20,Robot,"Hey Pennsylvania. Oh no, what will happen to all the letters in the tree?"
85,00:11:11,2021-06-07 10:00:25,Parent,What do you think is going to happen?
86,00:11:11,2021-06-07 10:00:25,Child,They're not going to fall down (laughs).
87,00:11:18,2021-06-07 10:00:32,Parent,"Well, look at the tree. What's happening?"
88,00:11:19,2021-06-07 10:00:33,Child,It's bending.
89,00:11:21,2021-06-07 10:00:35,Parent,So what's going to happen to the letters?
90,00:11:22,2021-06-07 10:00:36,Child,They're going to get flinged?
91,00:11:25,2021-06-07 10:00:39,Parent,Maybe. They might get flung.
92,00:11:27,2021-06-07 10:00:41,Child,(Laughs)
93,00:11:30,2021-06-07 10:00:44,Parent,"The whole alphabet up the ... Oh, no!"
94,00:11:30,2021-06-07 10:00:44,Child,Oh.
95,00:11:41,2021-06-07 10:00:55,Parent,"Chicka-chicka-boom-boom. So they didn't get flung, but what happened?"
96,00:11:43,2021-06-07 10:00:57,Child,They fell.
97,00:11:45,2021-06-07 10:00:59,Parent,"They all tumbled down. Skit-skat-skoodle-doop, flip-flop-flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree. Mommas and papas and uncles and aunts hug their little dears, then dust their pants."
98,00:11:45,2021-06-07 10:00:59,Child,(Laughs)
99,00:12:00,2021-06-07 10:01:14,Parent,"""Help us up,"" cried A, B, C. Next from the pile up, skin-kneed D, and stub-toed E, and patched-up F. Then comes G, all out of breath. H is tangled up with I. J and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie."
100,00:12:29,2021-06-07 10:01:43,Child,(Laughs)
101,00:12:29,2021-06-07 10:01:43,Parent,"M is looped, N is stooped, O is twisted alley-oop. Skit-skat-skoodle-doop, flip-flop-flee. Look who's coming, it's black-eyed P. And Q, R, S, and loose-toothed T."
102,00:12:51,2021-06-07 10:02:05,Robot,Can you point to the P's black eye?
103,00:12:55,2021-06-07 10:02:09,Parent,Where's the P's black eye?
104,00:12:55,2021-06-07 10:02:09,Child,Right ...
105,00:12:55,2021-06-07 10:02:09,Parent,Look on this-
106,00:12:55,2021-06-07 10:02:09,Child,... here.
107,00:13:07,2021-06-07 10:02:21,Parent,"Then U, V, W wiggle jiggle free. Last to come, X, Y, Z, and the sun goes down on the coconut tree. But chicka-chicka-boom-boom, look, there's a full moon. A is out of bed, and this is what he said. ""Dare, double dare, you can't catch me. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka-chicka-boom-boom."
108,00:13:34,2021-06-07 10:02:48,Child,Did you see the [inaudible 00:13:35]?
109,00:13:35,2021-06-07 10:02:49,Parent,"Yeah, I did. The end."
110,00:13:40,2021-06-07 10:02:54,Child,(Laughs) [crosstalk 00:13:40]
111,00:13:40,2021-06-07 10:02:54,Parent,I like Chicka-Chicka-Boom-Boom. That's one of my favorites.
112,00:13:40,2021-06-07 10:02:54,Child,Chicka-chicka-boom-bop?
113,00:13:40,2021-06-07 10:02:54,Parent,Hmm?
114,00:13:42,2021-06-07 10:02:56,Child,Chicka-chicka-boom-bop.
115,00:13:46,2021-06-07 10:03:00,Robot,"That was a great story. Yeah. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording, to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please com-"
