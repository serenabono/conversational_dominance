1,00:00:08,2021-06-15 18:27:35,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app."
2,00:00:27,2021-06-15 18:27:54,Parent,Hm.
3,00:00:28,2021-06-15 18:27:55,Robot,Let's go ahead and select a book on the app.
4,00:00:34,2021-06-15 18:28:01,Child,[inaudible 00:00:34]
5,00:00:42,2021-06-15 18:28:09,Parent,The Little Red Hen by Jerry Pinky... Pinkney.
6,00:00:45,2021-06-15 18:28:12,Child,Hey that almost says Pixar.
7,00:00:58,2021-06-15 18:28:25,Parent,It does. It does look like it... that would say Pixar.
8,00:00:58,2021-06-15 18:28:25,Child,"Yeah it almost says Pixar, and i- i- i-"
9,00:00:58,2021-06-15 18:28:25,Parent,What's Pixar?
10,00:01:02,2021-06-15 18:28:29,Child,Th- Th- The main movies a... Really main movies are Disney. L- l- l- like the ones that make the [inaudible 00:01:09]
11,00:01:22,2021-06-15 18:28:49,Robot,Yes.
12,00:01:27,2021-06-15 18:28:54,Parent,"Okay. Go ahead, turn the page."
13,00:01:27,2021-06-15 18:28:54,Child,That's weird. I said... There's usually answering questions on the worksheet.
14,00:01:40,2021-06-15 18:29:07,Parent,"I... That's okay. The little red hen greeting the sun with a cheery good morning. It was going to be an [inaudible 00:01:48] -for her young ones. She came across some strange seeds. Every so carefully she scooped them up and then headed home. On the way home, she greeted her neighbors. The short brown dog, the thin gray rat, the tall black goat, and the round pink pig."
15,00:02:23,2021-06-15 18:29:50,Child,I don't think that's her egg.
16,00:02:26,2021-06-15 18:29:53,Parent,"""I found these seeds."" She said. How many seeds do you think she found? Ten?"
17,00:02:30,2021-06-15 18:29:57,Child,"Or maybe... Maybe. Maybe. Maybe ten- [inaudible 00:02:44] How much did you think the little red hen got? H- hey Jibo, how did you-"
18,00:02:59,2021-06-15 18:30:26,Robot,Sorry?
19,00:03:00,2021-06-15 18:30:27,Parent,It's all right. Jibo. How many seeds did the little red hen find?
20,00:03:14,2021-06-15 18:30:41,Robot,"Um, I am not sure."
21,00:03:24,2021-06-15 18:30:51,Parent,Okay.
22,00:03:24,2021-06-15 18:30:51,Child,That will-
23,00:03:24,2021-06-15 18:30:51,Parent,We'll take... We'll take that.
24,00:03:25,2021-06-15 18:30:52,Child,"Jibo, that works fast."
25,00:03:35,2021-06-15 18:31:02,Robot,Do you know?
26,00:03:35,2021-06-15 18:31:02,Child,"No. Wait! We're supposed to be answering questions, not you."
27,00:03:35,2021-06-15 18:31:02,Parent,We don't know.
28,00:03:37,2021-06-15 18:31:04,Child,"Yes, but... Yes, but why is Jibo asking questions?"
29,00:03:40,2021-06-15 18:31:07,Parent,It's... They're talking to us.
30,00:03:40,2021-06-15 18:31:07,Child,Oh.
31,00:03:40,2021-06-15 18:31:07,Parent,Isn't... Isn't that fun?
32,00:03:40,2021-06-15 18:31:07,Child,Yeah.
33,00:03:54,2021-06-15 18:31:21,Parent,"Okay. Sit down. Can either of you tell me what they are? ""They're wheat seeds."" Said one of the animals. ""If you plant them, they'll turn into wheat for baking bread."""
34,00:04:01,2021-06-15 18:31:28,Child,Go.
35,00:04:06,2021-06-15 18:31:33,Parent,"""Who will help me plant the seeds?"" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I."" Said the rat. ""Not I."" Said the goat."""
36,00:04:15,2021-06-15 18:31:42,Child,"Not- not- n- not I... Not- n- not I... Not I- Not I... N- n- n- ""Not I."" Said the what?"
37,00:04:15,2021-06-15 18:31:42,Parent,Said the goat.
38,00:04:15,2021-06-15 18:31:42,Child,Said the goat.
39,00:04:37,2021-06-15 18:32:04,Parent,"""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Surely you will."" The little red hen said to the dog. ""You are so fond of digging."" ""Not I."" Said the dog."
40,00:04:47,2021-06-15 18:32:14,Child,Hey! H- hey that's the s... That's the same picture!
41,00:04:47,2021-06-15 18:32:14,Parent,Is it?
42,00:04:47,2021-06-15 18:32:14,Child,Yeah.
43,00:04:56,2021-06-15 18:32:23,Parent,It's totally the same picture.
44,00:05:00,2021-06-15 18:32:27,Child,We'll do this one.
45,00:05:02,2021-06-15 18:32:29,Parent,"""Very well then."" Said the little red hen. ""I will plant it."" A very busy hen was she."
46,00:05:02,2021-06-15 18:32:29,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
47,00:05:20,2021-06-15 18:32:47,Parent,"Jibo, who dug the holes in the ground?"
48,00:05:25,2021-06-15 18:32:52,Child,[inaudible 00:05:25]
49,00:05:30,2021-06-15 18:32:57,Robot,Maybe the little hen.
50,00:05:32,2021-06-15 18:32:59,Parent,Yes. You're right.
51,00:05:35,2021-06-15 18:33:02,Child,Yes. Yes you're right.
52,00:05:42,2021-06-15 18:33:09,Parent,"(laughs) Every day the little red hen scratched for food to feed her young ones. She also found time to care for the seedlings. She and her little chicks [inaudible 00:05:57]. Jibo, what does harvesting mean?"
53,00:06:14,2021-06-15 18:33:41,Robot,"Do you know, Alex?"
54,00:06:19,2021-06-15 18:33:46,Child,"Uh, uh, uh making?"
55,00:06:24,2021-06-15 18:33:51,Parent,That's close.
56,00:06:28,2021-06-15 18:33:55,Child,Does it mean making? Does it mean growing?
57,00:06:30,2021-06-15 18:33:57,Robot,"Um, that is close."
58,00:06:32,2021-06-15 18:33:59,Child,Does it mean growing?
59,00:06:36,2021-06-15 18:34:03,Parent,"Close. It means that it's ready, um... It means that it's grown and it's ready to make, uh, to- to be able to use to make something."
60,00:06:47,2021-06-15 18:34:14,Child,I got- I got a- a- a [inaudible 00:06:52]
61,00:07:02,2021-06-15 18:34:29,Parent,Good try. So-
62,00:07:03,2021-06-15 18:34:30,Child,[inaudible 00:07:03]
63,00:07:03,2021-06-15 18:34:30,Parent,"Flip the page. ""Who will help me cut and thresh the wheat?"" Asked she. ""Not I."" Said the goat. ""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Not I."" Said the dog. ""Surely you will."" The little red hen said to the rat. ""You can use your tail to chop it easily."" ""Not I."" Said the rat. That's kind of weird. The rat using the... his tail in order to chop the wheat. It's a little strange."
64,00:07:30,2021-06-15 18:34:57,Child,"Y- y- yeah, he would do that."
65,00:07:40,2021-06-15 18:35:07,Parent,"""Very well then, I will do it myself."" Said the little red hen. After snipping the stalks with her beak, she separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen was she."
66,00:07:49,2021-06-15 18:35:16,Child,Th- th- the little red hen has a lot of babies.
67,00:08:00,2021-06-15 18:35:27,Parent,Does she?
68,00:08:00,2021-06-15 18:35:27,Child,That's true!
69,00:08:03,2021-06-15 18:35:30,Parent,"""Who will take... who will help me take the grain to the mill?"" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Not I."" Said the dog."
70,00:08:14,2021-06-15 18:35:41,Child,W- w- why just the pig and the dog and not the rat?
71,00:08:19,2021-06-15 18:35:46,Parent,"That's probably on the next page. ""Not I."" Said the rat. ""Surely you will."" Said the little red hen to the goat. ""You are strong and steady and it's a lovely day to take out your cart."" ""Not I."" Said the goat."
72,00:08:35,2021-06-15 18:36:02,Child,W- w- w- w- wait. Wait. We got the same page.
73,00:08:36,2021-06-15 18:36:03,Parent,We did. It's the rest of the conversation.
74,00:08:36,2021-06-15 18:36:03,Child,Oh.
75,00:08:47,2021-06-15 18:36:14,Parent,"""Very well then-"" Sit up. ""Very well then."" Said the little red hen. Pay attention, please. ""I will do it myself."" So she fetched her shawl, then trenched off to the mill. Jibo, what is a shawl?"
76,00:09:12,2021-06-15 18:36:39,Robot,Can you point at the shawl?
77,00:09:19,2021-06-15 18:36:46,Parent,No.
78,00:09:19,2021-06-15 18:36:46,Robot,It is in the picture.
79,00:09:21,2021-06-15 18:36:48,Parent,Is it?
80,00:09:21,2021-06-15 18:36:48,Child,The shawl-
81,00:09:27,2021-06-15 18:36:54,Robot,Look closely at the little red hen-
82,00:09:29,2021-06-15 18:36:56,Parent,"Oh, okay."
83,00:09:29,2021-06-15 18:36:56,Robot,What is she wearing?
84,00:09:30,2021-06-15 18:36:57,Parent,Okay yeah. Can you point to the shawl?
85,00:09:30,2021-06-15 18:36:57,Child,What's a shawl?
86,00:09:34,2021-06-15 18:37:01,Parent,The shawl is right there. There it is!
87,00:09:41,2021-06-15 18:37:08,Robot,Do you know what shawl means now?
88,00:09:45,2021-06-15 18:37:12,Child,Scarf?
89,00:09:46,2021-06-15 18:37:13,Parent,So it's like... It's like a sweater.
90,00:09:46,2021-06-15 18:37:13,Child,Sweater?
91,00:09:48,2021-06-15 18:37:15,Robot,Ecxellent.
92,00:09:53,2021-06-15 18:37:20,Parent,Good job. Uh-
93,00:09:58,2021-06-15 18:37:25,Child,I still want to talk to you.
94,00:09:58,2021-06-15 18:37:25,Parent,M- Mister Miller ground her grain into flour and even gave her a jar of berry jam.
95,00:10:06,2021-06-15 18:37:33,Child,[inaudible 00:10:06]
96,00:10:07,2021-06-15 18:37:34,Parent,"The little red hen thanked him and began her long trek home. ""Who will help me break... bake the bread?"" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I."" Said the dog. ""Not I."" Said the rat. ""Not I."" Said the goat. ""Surely you will."" The little pig... The little red hen said to the pig. ""It won't take much effort at all, and you are always delighted with my cooking."" ""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Very well then."" Said the little red hen. ""I will do it myself."" She mixed the flour with yeast, salt and water, then kneaded the dough, shaved it into a loaf, and put it into the oven. At last, the bread was done. As the little red hen took the hot loaf out of the oven-"
97,00:11:02,2021-06-15 18:38:29,Child,Hey that... That's the same page.
98,00:11:05,2021-06-15 18:38:32,Parent,"It is. A tasty aroma circled the barnyard. ""I know will... who will eat the golden bread."" Said the little red hen. ""I surely will."" Said the short brown dog. ""I surely will."" Said the thin gray rat. ""I surely will."" Said the tall black goat. ""I surely will."" Said the r- round pink pig."" Who do you think's gonna eat it?"
99,00:11:32,2021-06-15 18:38:59,Child,"Uh, all of them. This is- This is a different version than the one we did the last time. There's [inaudible 00:11:38]"
100,00:11:42,2021-06-15 18:39:09,Parent,"""Oh no you won't."" Said the little red hen. ""You did not help me plant the seeds, or thresh the wheat-"""
101,00:11:48,2021-06-15 18:39:15,Child,B- b- but [inaudible 00:11:49]
102,00:11:49,2021-06-15 18:39:16,Parent,"""Or bake... take the grain to the miller, or bake the bread."""
103,00:11:54,2021-06-15 18:39:21,Child,"It's a different version, though."
104,00:11:56,2021-06-15 18:39:23,Parent,It's the... This still has the same story where- where-
105,00:11:58,2021-06-15 18:39:25,Child,B- b- but Mrs. [inaudible 00:12:01] told us that different words in there where she let them eat it.
106,00:12:15,2021-06-15 18:39:42,Parent,Do you think she should let them eat it?
107,00:12:16,2021-06-15 18:39:43,Child,Y- yeah. 'Cause that's what friends do. I think the neighbors are friends.
108,00:12:16,2021-06-15 18:39:43,Parent,Okay.
109,00:12:25,2021-06-15 18:39:52,Child,I- I think this counts as two... As an extra story.
110,00:12:27,2021-06-15 18:39:54,Parent,"It does not. So hit bookshelf, please."
111,00:12:31,2021-06-15 18:39:58,Child,[inaudible 00:12:31]
112,00:12:30,2021-06-15 18:39:57,Robot,That was a great story.

116,00:12:41,2021-06-15 18:40:08,Parent,Sure. Which one do you wanna pick? You want that one? Chicka Chicka Boom Boom.
117,00:13:10,2021-06-15 18:40:37,Child,Will there be enough room? Will there be enough room?
118,00:13:17,2021-06-15 18:40:44,Parent,"I don't know, do you think there will be enough room?"
119,00:13:25,2021-06-15 18:40:52,Child,"Beats me. L- l- literally, the alphabet b- beats me in the race. Why did they get to ride the dragon when I could only ride the race car? Uh, we actually- we actually- we actually builded the dragon. How'd they build... How did they build- how did they build it? How did they build a dragon?"
120,00:13:45,2021-06-15 18:41:12,Parent,I don't... Well we... Let's read the book though.

123,00:13:50,2021-06-15 18:41:17,Child,"A, B, C. They're the ones that beat me in the race."
124,00:13:50,2021-06-15 18:41:17,Parent,Okay. So hit the page turn.

148,00:16:14,2021-06-15 18:43:41,Child,What were we ending with?
149,00:16:19,2021-06-15 18:43:46,Parent,That was a K. Do you remember the rest... The rest of the alphabet?
150,00:16:19,2021-06-15 18:43:46,Child,"Uh, no."
