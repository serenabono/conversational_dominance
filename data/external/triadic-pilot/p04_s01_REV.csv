1,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Child,Jibo.
2,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Parent,I think he's ready for listening on.
3,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Child,It's Jibo. Jibo.
4,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Parent,Did I say Chibo?
5,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Child,Yeah.
6,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Parent,(laughs).
7,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Robot,Hello. Morning.
8,00:00:00,2021-05-05 08:06:20,Child,Morning.
9,00:00:21,2021-05-05 08:06:41,Robot,I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started.
10,00:00:29,2021-05-05 08:06:49,Parent,Whoo-hoo!
11,00:00:30,2021-05-05 08:06:50,Robot,"Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Story Time App. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
12,00:00:41,2021-05-05 08:07:01,Parent,"Okay, do you want short story or long story?"
13,00:00:41,2021-05-05 08:07:01,Child,Long story again.
14,00:00:41,2021-05-05 08:07:01,Parent,Okay.
15,00:00:44,2021-05-05 08:07:04,Child,Long story.
16,00:00:52,2021-05-05 08:07:12,Parent,"Yes, well, let's choose different stories."
17,00:00:54,2021-05-05 08:07:14,Child,[crosstalk 00:00:54]-
18,00:00:54,2021-05-05 08:07:14,Parent,"So look, there's more books to choose from. You wanna hit more books?"
19,00:00:54,2021-05-05 08:07:14,Child,More books.
20,00:01:00,2021-05-05 08:07:20,Parent,"Well, you were supposed to hit it, and it didn't work. Oh, there we go. Three Little Pigs, The Year at Maple Hill Farm. Three, which one?"
21,00:01:00,2021-05-05 08:07:20,Child,This one.
22,00:01:12,2021-05-05 08:07:32,Parent,"Yeah? Okay, we're ready Jibu. Jibo. Okay, ready? The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now, be sure to write,"" she said, ""and remember that I love you."" See, she's crying."
23,00:01:34,2021-05-05 08:07:54,Child,Yeah.
24,00:01:34,2021-05-05 08:07:54,Parent,She's sad that they're leaving?
25,00:01:35,2021-05-05 08:07:55,Child,Yeah. And finding their own home.
26,00:01:39,2021-05-05 08:07:59,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man. ""Mind your own business sa-... Thank you,"" said the little pig. And he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all. Very soon a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door. He said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no. Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."" You know this."
27,00:02:23,2021-05-05 08:08:43,Robot,"Hey, Adam, why is the wolf lean?"
28,00:02:29,2021-05-05 08:08:49,Parent,"Why is he lean? It means, like, thin, skinny."
29,00:02:33,2021-05-05 08:08:53,Child,"Uh, that's just what wolves are like."
30,00:02:42,2021-05-05 08:09:02,Parent,You don't think it's because he's-
31,00:02:42,2021-05-05 08:09:02,Child,Hungry.
32,00:02:42,2021-05-05 08:09:02,Parent,Because he needs to eat (laughs). This an-
33,00:02:46,2021-05-05 08:09:06,Robot,[crosstalk 00:02:46]-
34,00:02:50,2021-05-05 08:09:10,Parent,"Oop! (laughs) This annoyed the wolf to no end. And he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig. Oh no!"
35,00:03:04,2021-05-05 08:09:24,Child,No he didn't.
36,00:03:07,2021-05-05 08:09:27,Parent,That's what it says.
37,00:03:07,2021-05-05 08:09:27,Child,I don't think so.
38,00:03:09,2021-05-05 08:09:29,Parent,"The second little pit met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. But did he sell them?"
39,00:03:22,2021-05-05 08:09:42,Child,Yes.
40,00:03:24,2021-05-05 08:09:44,Parent,"""Oh, poo."" Said the little pig. ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty,"" he said. Ooh, look at the house."
41,00:03:34,2021-05-05 08:09:54,Robot,What do you think will happen to the second little pig?
42,00:03:36,2021-05-05 08:09:56,Parent,"Oh, look at the picture!"
43,00:03:36,2021-05-05 08:09:56,Child,He'll get gobbled.
44,00:03:36,2021-05-05 08:09:56,Parent,He'll get what?
45,00:03:36,2021-05-05 08:09:56,Child,Eaten.
46,00:03:41,2021-05-05 08:10:01,Parent,He'll get eaten?
47,00:03:44,2021-05-05 08:10:04,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
48,00:03:44,2021-05-05 08:10:04,Parent,Why?
49,00:03:44,2021-05-05 08:10:04,Child,"'Cause, 'cause, 'cause that's what it said on the short page. And maybe it will happen on this page."
50,00:03:51,2021-05-05 08:10:11,Parent,Do you think that the house of sticks is strong or weak?
51,00:03:55,2021-05-05 08:10:15,Child,Weak.
52,00:03:55,2021-05-05 08:10:15,Parent,Weak?
53,00:03:57,2021-05-05 08:10:17,Child,"Yeah, but the bricks one-"
54,00:03:58,2021-05-05 08:10:18,Parent,"Oh, you know... You know this story, so it's easy to, to have an idea. Yeah, okay. So it says, no sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry, and he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no! Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."" So what did the wolf do?"
55,00:04:21,2021-05-05 08:10:41,Child,He blew his house down.
56,00:04:24,2021-05-05 08:10:44,Parent,"Oh, no. The wolf didn't care for that at all. He said, ""I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!"" ""Ha, ha, ha,"" said the little (laughing), said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little-"
57,00:04:43,2021-05-05 08:11:03,Child,Pig.
58,00:04:43,2021-05-05 08:11:03,Parent,"... pig. Now the third little pig met a man with a load of stick. ""These bricks will make a fi-""... I'm sorry, bricks (laughs). ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the little pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig, ""nice and solid."" Look at that house. But no sooner had the little pig moved in then, than he noticed the wolf loitering about. That's like hanging about. And the wolf, who was still hungry, said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no! Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin."""
59,00:05:35,2021-05-05 08:11:55,Robot,What does loitering mean?
60,00:05:35,2021-05-05 08:11:55,Parent,"Remember, I just said it?"
61,00:05:35,2021-05-05 08:11:55,Child,I don't know.
62,00:05:41,2021-05-05 08:12:01,Parent,Loitering means what?
63,00:05:41,2021-05-05 08:12:01,Child,I don't know.
64,00:05:42,2021-05-05 08:12:02,Parent,It's just-
65,00:05:43,2021-05-05 08:12:03,Child,[inaudible 00:05:43]-
66,00:05:43,2021-05-05 08:12:03,Parent,... hanging around?
67,00:05:43,2021-05-05 08:12:03,Child,Hanging around.
68,00:05:43,2021-05-05 08:12:03,Parent,Tell it to Jibo.
69,00:05:43,2021-05-05 08:12:03,Child,It just means he's hanging around.
70,00:05:51,2021-05-05 08:12:11,Robot,You are right.
71,00:05:53,2021-05-05 08:12:13,Parent,"(laughs) Mommy told you, that's why Jibo asked, because I had already just told you so [inaudible 00:05:57] the thing he asked, huh?"
72,00:06:00,2021-05-05 08:12:20,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
73,00:06:00,2021-05-05 08:12:20,Parent,"So now you know loitering means just, like, hanging around."
74,00:06:03,2021-05-05 08:12:23,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
75,00:06:05,2021-05-05 08:12:25,Parent,"Yeah. So, well, the wolf had heard that before. He said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little pig. Why not? But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf. That means I'll try a different [inaudible 00:06:33]. And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""Little pig, I was only teasing,"" he said. ""By the way, I hear tell that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips."" Hm. ""So,"" I'm sorry, ""shall we go pick a few?"" ""I am much too busy now,"" said the little pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at six."" I don't know this part [inaudible 00:07:05], did you?"
76,00:07:05,2021-05-05 08:13:25,Robot,What is the wolf doing?
77,00:07:05,2021-05-05 08:13:25,Parent,What's he doing?
78,00:07:05,2021-05-05 08:13:25,Child,Making friends?
79,00:07:11,2021-05-05 08:13:31,Parent,"What is he trying to do to the pig, though? He's trying to get him where?"
80,00:07:13,2021-05-05 08:13:33,Child,"Uh, eat?"
81,00:07:17,2021-05-05 08:13:37,Parent,Get him out of his-
82,00:07:18,2021-05-05 08:13:38,Child,House.
83,00:07:19,2021-05-05 08:13:39,Parent,... so that he can do-
84,00:07:19,2021-05-05 08:13:39,Robot,I think so.
85,00:07:19,2021-05-05 08:13:39,Parent,So he can do what?
86,00:07:19,2021-05-05 08:13:39,Child,"Um, so he can eat him?"
87,00:07:27,2021-05-05 08:13:47,Parent,"Probably, that's what I think. The next morning the little pig got up at five, hurried off to [inaudible 00:07:34] the Farmer John's turnip field, picked a basket full of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at six, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done,"" he said. ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree down at Merry Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips,"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say at five?"" He is desperate, huh? The next morning, the little pig was up at four and went off to the apples. It took longer than he had expected to reach Merry Meadow. Mm-hmm (affirmative). And while busy gathering apples in the highest trees, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. He tricked the wolf. The next day the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go on a... Go a fair with me tomorrow? Or go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there,"" said the little pig. ""Would three o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal,"" said the wolf, ""three it is."" Just to make sure he would be there at two. 'Cause he's learned that the [crosstalk 00:09:08]-"
88,00:09:07,2021-05-05 08:15:27,Robot,What do you think will happen in the fair?
89,00:09:09,2021-05-05 08:15:29,Child,They will try to chase each other.
90,00:09:09,2021-05-05 08:15:29,Robot,Yeah.
91,00:09:19,2021-05-05 08:15:39,Parent,"(laughs) At one in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair. So the pig was even smarter. He went two hours earlier. So at one in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time. So fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out the corner of his eye, he saw... Who?"
92,00:09:37,2021-05-05 08:15:57,Child,The wolf.
93,00:09:41,2021-05-05 08:16:01,Parent,"The wolf coming up the hill. So what's gonna happen? Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That he-"
94,00:09:58,2021-05-05 08:16:18,Robot,What would you do if you were in a situation like wolf?
95,00:10:00,2021-05-05 08:16:20,Child,I would run.
96,00:10:05,2021-05-05 08:16:25,Parent,You think he did the right thing?
97,00:10:07,2021-05-05 08:16:27,Child,Yes. He ran.
98,00:10:08,2021-05-05 08:16:28,Robot,"Me, too."
99,00:10:11,2021-05-05 08:16:31,Parent,"(laughs) That evening the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been, he had been by a great round thing that came down the hill. ""Frighten you, did I?"" Said the little pig. ""That great round thing was a butter churn, and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now!"" And he climbed onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire, got the fire started. ""Here I come!"" Cried the wolf. ""Dinner time!"" You-"
100,00:10:56,2021-05-05 08:17:16,Robot,What will happen to the wolf now?
101,00:10:58,2021-05-05 08:17:18,Child,He'll get burned (laughs).
102,00:11:01,2021-05-05 08:17:21,Robot,"Uh-huh (affirmative), yeah."
103,00:11:03,2021-05-05 08:17:23,Parent,"(laughs) ""You can say that again,"" said the little pig, and he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up! The end."
104,00:11:13,2021-05-05 08:17:33,Robot,Wow.
105,00:11:14,2021-05-05 08:17:34,Parent,Wow is right.
106,00:11:16,2021-05-05 08:17:36,Child,Now let's do another.
107,00:11:18,2021-05-05 08:17:38,Parent,"Do we have time for another one, Jibo, Jibo?"
108,00:11:22,2021-05-05 08:17:42,Robot,That was a great story.
109,00:11:24,2021-05-05 08:17:44,Parent,(laughs).
110,00:11:24,2021-05-05 08:17:44,Robot,Want to read another one?
111,00:11:27,2021-05-05 08:17:47,Child,Yes.
112,00:11:28,2021-05-05 08:17:48,Parent,Sure.
113,00:11:29,2021-05-05 08:17:49,Robot,[inaudible 00:11:29].
114,00:11:28,2021-05-05 08:17:48,Parent,"Mm, let's see. I think there's only those two. Yeah. Do you wanna read one from here, or from the other page."
115,00:11:28,2021-05-05 08:17:48,Child,The other page.
116,00:11:50,2021-05-05 08:18:10,Parent,"You have to choose one. The Little Red Hen. Ready? One summer day, the little red hen found a grain of wheat. ""A grain of wheat!"" Said the little red hen to herself, ""I will plant it."" She asked the duck, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. She asked the goose, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the goose. She asked the cat, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the cat."
117,00:12:23,2021-05-05 08:18:43,Child,They're all too busy.
118,00:12:26,2021-05-05 08:18:46,Robot,"If the hen asked you, would you plant the wheat with her?"
119,00:12:34,2021-05-05 08:18:54,Child,Yes.
120,00:12:34,2021-05-05 08:18:54,Parent,"Sit up. He said, yes."
121,00:12:35,2021-05-05 08:18:55,Robot,That is nice.
122,00:12:36,2021-05-05 08:18:56,Parent,"That is very nice. She asked the pig, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the pig."
123,00:12:43,2021-05-05 08:19:03,Child,They're all too busy.
124,00:12:45,2021-05-05 08:19:05,Parent,They're all too busy. But should we be too busy to help our friends?
125,00:12:51,2021-05-05 08:19:11,Child,Nope.
126,00:12:51,2021-05-05 08:19:11,Parent,"Or family? ""Then I will plant it myself,"" said the little red hen."
127,00:12:56,2021-05-05 08:19:16,Child,[crosstalk 00:12:56] other people.
128,00:12:57,2021-05-05 08:19:17,Parent,"Or other people, right."
129,00:12:57,2021-05-05 08:19:17,Child,"Yeah, right."
130,00:12:58,2021-05-05 08:19:18,Parent,"And she did. She planted it herself. Soon the wheat grew tall and the little red hen knew it was time to reap it. ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" She asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will reap it myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour. ""Who will help me carry the wheat to the mill?"" She asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig."
131,00:13:41,2021-05-05 08:20:01,Robot,Have you ever said no to a friend when they asked for your help?
132,00:13:51,2021-05-05 08:20:11,Child,"No, I haven't. Or [inaudible 00:13:52]."
133,00:13:51,2021-05-05 08:20:11,Parent,Mm.
134,00:13:51,2021-05-05 08:20:11,Child,My friends.
135,00:13:51,2021-05-05 08:20:11,Parent,"I don't think so. Say it loud, I don't think Jibo heard you."
136,00:13:56,2021-05-05 08:20:16,Robot,You are a very nice friend.
137,00:13:58,2021-05-05 08:20:18,Parent,Very nice.

139,00:14:01,2021-05-05 08:20:21,Parent,"Yeah, she's under the table, but let's not be distracted. Then-"
140,00:14:04,2021-05-05 08:20:24,Robot,We could be best friends.
141,00:14:05,2021-05-05 08:20:25,Parent,(laughs).
142,00:14:09,2021-05-05 08:20:29,Child,[inaudible 00:14:09].
143,00:14:08,2021-05-05 08:20:28,Parent,"""Then I will carry it myself,"" up here, said the little red hen. And she did. She carried the wheat... She can't come up."
144,00:14:16,2021-05-05 08:20:36,Child,[crosstalk 00:14:16]-
145,00:14:16,2021-05-05 08:20:36,Parent,"She carried the wheat to the mill, and the mill... and the miller made it into flour. Come on, honey. When she got it home she asked, ""Who will help me make the flour into dough?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. What's the cat say?"
146,00:14:33,2021-05-05 08:20:53,Child,Not I.
147,00:14:34,2021-05-05 08:20:54,Parent,"""Not I."" ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will make the dough myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did. Soon the bread was ready to go into the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" Said the little red hen. What do you think their answers are gonna be?"
148,00:14:50,2021-05-05 08:21:10,Child,No.
149,00:14:50,2021-05-05 08:21:10,Parent,"""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will bake it myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did. After the loaf had been taken from the oven, it was set on the window sill to cool. Mm, I know what happens. Do you know?"
150,00:14:50,2021-05-05 08:21:10,Child,What?
151,00:14:50,2021-05-05 08:21:10,Parent,What do you think's gonna happen?
152,00:15:09,2021-05-05 08:21:29,Child,I don't know.
153,00:15:13,2021-05-05 08:21:33,Parent,"They're all saying no, they don't wanna help m- make it, but once sh- once it's made, what do you think they're gonna do?"
154,00:15:21,2021-05-05 08:21:41,Child,Say yes.
155,00:15:23,2021-05-05 08:21:43,Parent,Yes to what?
156,00:15:23,2021-05-05 08:21:43,Child,Yes to making it?
157,00:15:24,2021-05-05 08:21:44,Parent,"Well, she already made it. What do you-"
158,00:15:32,2021-05-05 08:21:52,Child,Yes-
159,00:15:32,2021-05-05 08:21:52,Parent,... they're gonna wanna do?
160,00:15:32,2021-05-05 08:21:52,Child,... to eating.
161,00:15:32,2021-05-05 08:21:52,Parent,They're gonna wanna eat it.
162,00:15:32,2021-05-05 08:21:52,Robot,"I think so, too."
163,00:15:36,2021-05-05 08:21:56,Parent,"(laughs) ""And now,"" said the little red hen, ""Who will help me eat the bread?"" ""I will!"" Said the duck. ""I will!"" Said the goose. ""I will!"" Said the cat. ""I will!"" Said the pig. ""No, I will eat it myself,"" said the little red hen. And she did."
164,00:15:57,2021-05-05 08:22:17,Child,Selfish.
165,00:15:58,2021-05-05 08:22:18,Parent,"Well, did they offer to help?"
166,00:16:01,2021-05-05 08:22:21,Robot,The little red hen made the bread all by herself. Nobody helped her.
167,00:16:06,2021-05-05 08:22:26,Parent,So she got to enjoy-
168,00:16:10,2021-05-05 08:22:30,Robot,Do you think you would be able to eat like the little red hen?
169,00:16:10,2021-05-05 08:22:30,Child,No.
170,00:16:10,2021-05-05 08:22:30,Parent,Why not?
171,00:16:10,2021-05-05 08:22:30,Child,Because I-
172,00:16:15,2021-05-05 08:22:35,Parent,"What would you do? Even if they didn't help you, what do you think would happen?"
173,00:16:21,2021-05-05 08:22:41,Child,I would say yeah when they wanted to eat it.
174,00:16:23,2021-05-05 08:22:43,Parent,"Oh, you would still share it, even though they didn't wanna help you?"
175,00:16:25,2021-05-05 08:22:45,Child,Yeah.
176,00:16:25,2021-05-05 08:22:45,Parent,"Well, that's nice."
177,00:16:25,2021-05-05 08:22:45,Child,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Um, that one?"
178,00:16:30,2021-05-05 08:22:50,Parent,"That is very nice. I'm not sure if we have time. Hey, Jib-"
179,00:16:32,2021-05-05 08:22:52,Robot,That was a great story. Want to read another one?
180,00:16:42,2021-05-05 08:23:02,Parent,"Sure, let's read, um, let's read one of the shorter books."
181,00:16:42,2021-05-05 08:23:02,Child,No! I wa-
182,00:16:42,2021-05-05 08:23:02,Parent,You wanna read one of these? That one?
183,00:16:48,2021-05-05 08:23:08,Child,"No, no, no."
184,00:16:48,2021-05-05 08:23:08,Parent,That's the same story as the other one we read.
185,00:16:50,2021-05-05 08:23:10,Child,What other one?
186,00:16:53,2021-05-05 08:23:13,Parent,Three Billy Goat Gruff.
187,00:16:56,2021-05-05 08:23:16,Child,But what kind is that?
188,00:16:57,2021-05-05 08:23:17,Parent,It's like the same one with the goats.
189,00:17:00,2021-05-05 08:23:20,Child,But-
190,00:17:00,2021-05-05 08:23:20,Parent,And the bridge.
191,00:17:02,2021-05-05 08:23:22,Child,But I wanna read it.
192,00:17:02,2021-05-05 08:23:22,Parent,"Okay, fine with me."
193,00:17:02,2021-05-05 08:23:22,Child,'Cause this is the newbie.
194,00:17:07,2021-05-05 08:23:27,Parent,"This is a, just a different version."
195,00:17:08,2021-05-05 08:23:28,Child,Yeah.
196,00:17:08,2021-05-05 08:23:28,Parent,"Once upon a time there were three billy goats. They lived in a valley, and the name of all three billy goats was Gruff. Gruff, Gruff, Gruff. There was very little grass in the valley and the billy goats were hungry. They wanted to go up the hillside to a fine meadow full of grass and daisies where they could eat and eat and eat and get fat."
197,00:17:31,2021-05-05 08:23:51,Child,(laughs).
198,00:17:31,2021-05-05 08:23:51,Parent,"(laughs) But on the way up, there was a bridge over a rushing river. And under the bridge lived a troll who as as mean as he was ugly."
199,00:17:31,2021-05-05 08:23:51,Robot,Is the troll good or bad?
200,00:17:48,2021-05-05 08:24:08,Parent,"He asked you, ask him... Say what did you [inaudible 00:17:52] say?"
201,00:17:48,2021-05-05 08:24:08,Child,"What did you say? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you."
202,00:17:56,2021-05-05 08:24:16,Robot,Is the troll good or bad?
203,00:17:56,2021-05-05 08:24:16,Child,He's bad.
204,00:18:03,2021-05-05 08:24:23,Robot,"Yeah, I think so."
205,00:18:05,2021-05-05 08:24:25,Parent,"(laughs) So first, the youngest billy goat decided to cross the bridge. Trip-trap, trip-trap, on the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the tiniest billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat in his very small voice, ""and I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat!"" ""No you're not,"" said the troll, ""for I'm coming to gobble you up!"" ""Oh, please don't take me! I'm too little, that I am,"" said the billy goat, ""wait till the second billy goat Gruff comes, he's much bigger."" ""Well, then, be off with you,"" said the troll. That troll is much scarier than the other one, huh?"
206,00:18:05,2021-05-05 08:24:25,Child,Yeah.
207,00:18:51,2021-05-05 08:25:11,Parent,"(laughs) All that hair. A little later the second billy goat Gruff came to, to cross the bridge. Trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap went the bridge. Did you [inaudible 00:19:06] (laughs)? ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. Okay. ""Oh, it's only I,"" said, uh, the second billy goat Gruff."
208,00:19:14,2021-05-05 08:25:34,Child,[inaudible 00:19:14].
209,00:19:15,2021-05-05 08:25:35,Parent,"No, no, no, no, not right now. ""And I'm going up to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the billy goat. And his voice was not so small. ""No you're not,"" said the troll-"
210,00:19:26,2021-05-05 08:25:46,Robot,Do you remember what happened to the second billy goat Gruff?
211,00:19:28,2021-05-05 08:25:48,Parent,Do you remember?
212,00:19:29,2021-05-05 08:25:49,Child,He went into the rocks.
213,00:19:34,2021-05-05 08:25:54,Robot,Yeah.
214,00:19:37,2021-05-05 08:25:57,Parent,"Says, ""No you're not,"" said the troll, ""for I'm coming to gobble you up!"" ""Please don't take me, wait a little till the third billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."" ""Very well, be off with you,"" said the troll. He got really lucky, huh?"
215,00:19:37,2021-05-05 08:25:57,Child,Yeah.
216,00:19:51,2021-05-05 08:26:11,Parent,"Mm. Then up came the third billy goat Gruff. Trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap went the bridge. The third billy goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. It made noises, [inaudible 00:20:12]. Look at his hair hiding his... ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll."
217,00:20:19,2021-05-05 08:26:39,Child,He's scared.
218,00:20:20,2021-05-05 08:26:40,Parent,"Yeah, little bit. ""It is I, the big billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat, and his voice was as loud as the troll's? ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up!"" Roared the troll. ""Well, come along,"" said the billy goat Gruff, ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do!"""
219,00:20:45,2021-05-05 08:27:05,Robot,"Adam, what do you think will happen to troll?"
220,00:20:48,2021-05-05 08:27:08,Child,"He will, the, he, the goat will bust him off."
221,00:20:56,2021-05-05 08:27:16,Robot,Correct.
222,00:21:00,2021-05-05 08:27:20,Parent,"(laughs) So up climbed that mean, ugly troll. And the big billy goat Gruff butted him with his ho- with his horns, and he trampled him with his hard hooves. Arr! Knock him over. (laughs) And he tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river. Then the big billy goat Gruff went up the hillside to join his brothers. Look at this, look at the troll. What's he doing?"
223,00:21:25,2021-05-05 08:27:45,Child,He's trying to get out there.
224,00:21:27,2021-05-05 08:27:47,Parent,"Yeah, but he's stuck in the water."
225,00:21:27,2021-05-05 08:27:47,Child,Yeah.
226,00:21:32,2021-05-05 08:27:52,Parent,"In the meadow, the three billy goat Gruffs got so fat that they could hardly walk home again. They are probably there yet, so snip, snap, snout, this tale is told out. The end."
227,00:21:45,2021-05-05 08:28:05,Robot,"Adam, what makes the billy goats Gruffs look different?"
228,00:21:48,2021-05-05 08:28:08,Child,"Um, they're fat."
229,00:21:52,2021-05-05 08:28:12,Robot,Can we please go back to the previous page.
230,00:21:55,2021-05-05 08:28:15,Parent,"Yes. Right, we went out of the story."
231,00:22:00,2021-05-05 08:28:20,Robot,Thank you.
232,00:22:04,2021-05-05 08:28:24,Parent,"So what made them look different, he said?"
233,00:22:04,2021-05-05 08:28:24,Child,They have longer horns.
234,00:22:09,2021-05-05 08:28:29,Parent,"They, what? What did they do in the, in the, um, in the meadow?"
235,00:22:17,2021-05-05 08:28:37,Child,They ate all the grass.
236,00:22:18,2021-05-05 08:28:38,Parent,Ate all the grass?
237,00:22:18,2021-05-05 08:28:38,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
238,00:22:19,2021-05-05 08:28:39,Parent,"So what, what changed?"
239,00:22:20,2021-05-05 08:28:40,Robot,"Uh-huh (affirmative), I agree."
240,00:22:20,2021-05-05 08:28:40,Child,They got bigger.
241,00:22:26,2021-05-05 08:28:46,Parent,They got bigger. 'Cause they ate so much food.
242,00:22:26,2021-05-05 08:28:46,Robot,You're right.
243,00:22:26,2021-05-05 08:28:46,Child,Yeah.
244,00:22:32,2021-05-05 08:28:52,Parent,"(laughs) Good job, buddy."
245,00:22:34,2021-05-05 08:28:54,Child,Bye-bye.
246,00:22:37,2021-05-05 08:28:57,Parent,"Well, we don't know yet. We have to wait."
247,00:22:38,2021-05-05 08:28:58,Robot,What was the favorite part of the story?
248,00:22:41,2021-05-05 08:29:01,Child,"Um, mm, when the troll went... The goats win!"
249,00:22:51,2021-05-05 08:29:11,Parent,When the goats win. Stay up here so they can see you.
250,00:22:56,2021-05-05 08:29:16,Robot,"That's my favorite part, too."
251,00:22:57,2021-05-05 08:29:17,Parent,"(laughs) Sit up! Can you sit up, please? Did you like that story?"
252,00:22:57,2021-05-05 08:29:17,Child,Yes.
253,00:23:06,2021-05-05 08:29:26,Parent,Yeah. So what'd they do to the troll?
254,00:23:07,2021-05-05 08:29:27,Child,They [inaudible 00:23:08] have no idea.
255,00:23:12,2021-05-05 08:29:32,Parent,I don't know. [crosstalk 00:23:13]-
256,00:23:13,2021-05-05 08:29:33,Child,He sunk. He sunk.
257,00:23:14,2021-05-05 08:29:34,Parent,Maybe he just went swimming?
258,00:23:15,2021-05-05 08:29:35,Child,No. He sunk.
259,00:23:17,2021-05-05 08:29:37,Parent,"But they tricked him, right?"
260,00:23:19,2021-05-05 08:29:39,Child,Yeah.
261,00:23:20,2021-05-05 08:29:40,Parent,Tricked him... Come over here.
262,00:23:20,2021-05-05 08:29:40,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).

265,00:23:24,2021-05-05 08:29:44,Parent,"Do we have time for another, Jibo? Or are we done?"
266,00:23:28,2021-05-05 08:29:48,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
267,00:23:35,2021-05-05 08:29:55,Parent,Yay!
268,00:23:36,2021-05-05 08:29:56,Child,Bye.
269,00:23:36,2021-05-05 08:29:56,Robot,I had so much fun.
270,00:23:37,2021-05-05 08:29:57,Child,Bye.
271,00:23:38,2021-05-05 08:29:58,Robot,I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
272,00:23:41,2021-05-05 08:30:01,Parent,"Thank you, Jibo."
273,00:23:41,2021-05-05 08:30:01,Robot,"Please give me a few minutes to reset, I will switch back to leisure mode shortly."
