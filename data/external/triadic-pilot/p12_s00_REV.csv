0,00:00:00,2021-05-26 16:37:46,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:01,2021-05-26 16:37:47,Parent,"Hi. Hi, Jibo."
2,00:00:01,2021-05-26 16:37:47,Child,"Hi, Jibo."
3,00:00:05,2021-05-26 16:37:51,Robot,"I'm now on story-time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. I may behave a little differently in story-time mode. I will not responding to, ""Hey, Jibo,"" and I will not turn blue, but we can still chat. Because today is our first session I would first like to learn how you guys read books without me. Today I will just be listening here. Let's get started. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story-time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:45,2021-05-26 16:38:31,Parent,Do you want a short story or a long story?
5,00:00:45,2021-05-26 16:38:31,Child,Long.
6,00:00:47,2021-05-26 16:38:33,Parent,"Okay, long. And then this says Geraldine, The Music Mouse. This is... I can't read it. The Three Billy Go- Bo- Goats Grute I guess it says. The Little Red Hen, The Little Red Hen, The Three Billy Goats Gruffs. Why do you want the one I could really read? (laughs). Gruff, gruff. Okay, so let's start reading, yeah? Huh. I don't know what to do. First page. Oh yeah, first page. [inaudible 00:01:44]."
7,00:01:47,2021-05-26 16:39:33,Child,[inaudible 00:01:47].
8,00:01:49,2021-05-26 16:39:35,Parent,"Maybe we selected the wrong book. [inaudible 00:01:53]. And this is the same book as that. Or do you want more books? More books. It looks like there's The Year on Maple Hill Farm, The Three Little Pigs, all the same books. Three Little Pigs again. Oh, this is Fall, Spring and Summer. Um, and that's it. Which one do you want? Spring?"
9,00:01:49,2021-05-26 16:39:35,Child,"Spring, spring. There."
10,00:02:32,2021-05-26 16:40:18,Parent,First page.
11,00:02:37,2021-05-26 16:40:23,Robot,Touch the bottom corners to flip pages.
12,00:02:40,2021-05-26 16:40:26,Parent,"Bottom corners. Alex, stop pushing. Bottom corners. Oh, there we go, yay! Stop touch... the ear. This is a book about farm animals and what happens during one year on the farm. The year is divided into 12 months. The months are divided into weeks, the weeks into days, the days into minutes, and on the farm something is happening every minute. Animals don't know there is such as thing a year, but they do know about seasons. Animals know when the cold will come and they grow heavy overcoats. They when it is summer and they shed them. When it is hot, they look for shade. And in winter they look for shelter. People have names for what they call the months of the year. We could start with any month as far as the animals are concerned, but it is usual to begin with January. January is a winter month. The ground is covered with snow. Cows stay in the barnyard when the ground is frozen. So do chickens, but not many eggs are laid in January. The days are too short and dark. The horses don't mind the cold. Neither do the sheep with their heavy winter coats. It is a cold gray time of year and night falls early. All the farm animals stay close to the barn where they are fed. There is hay and grain to eat. Even the wild deer come near the farm hoping to find a little salt or windfall apple under the snow. February follows January. The forest pond is frozen solid, all but a marshy place where the spring water feeds the farm. The children are having a skating party. When they are cold they sit by the fire and toast their toes and noses. The geese play in the icy water all winter. You'd think their bare feet would freeze, but they never do. They noisy rooks are having a circus. They toss and tumble on the trapeze of bare branches. Rooks like winter. Under the ice in a tunnel, in the frozen ground the water rat is napping. He won't be up until spring. [inaudible 00:05:44]? March is a windy month. It is still cold outside, but you can tell spring is coming. There are signs of spring in the barn. The pony has given birth to a foal. She loves him and looks after him. The milk cow has a new calf. She loves him and gives him her milk. The good gray barn cat has her litter of kittens in the hayrack. The mother ey- ewe has two new lambs. The nanny goat has a new kid, too. All animal mothers are proud and protective, and full of love. March is windy and rainy. But when the sun does shine, it shines more brightly and the days are longer. There are signs of spring everywhere. The robins are back and are busy building their nests. A wild duck is in the marsh marigolds. A rooster wakes everyone earlier in the morning. The geese are cranky. They must have laid an egg. The meadow mice are out looking around. The Mad March hare is hurrying in all directions. The ice on the pond has melted and there are pussy willows. The horses have found the little grass and they're [inaudible 00:07:20] the last patches of snow. They lie down in the pale sunshine. You don't see that often if the ground is frozen. April is a spring month. You can tell that spring is here by all the eggs. Eggs in the barn, in the fields, in the trees, under the caves, everywhere. The good old brown hen has been busy sitting on eggs for 21 days. Now her baby chicks are hatching. It must be hard to pick your way out of an egg, but the chicks are pretty and fluffy in no time. The robins are already hatching eggs in their business-like way. The silly goose has laid an egg in the middle of nowhere. She must be crazy. This big bird is laying her egg in the little bird's nest. She must be cuckoo. This little bird is feeding her babies. She must wonder why one baby is so big. Here is a basket of colored eggs among the flowers. No one has found it yet. Dogs steal eggs when they can find them and carry them away. Perhaps dogs make nests, too. Is that true?"
13,00:02:40,2021-05-26 16:40:26,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
14,00:08:46,2021-05-26 16:46:32,Parent,"May days are warm. The animals are uncomfortable with their heavy coats. They will all be cooler without them. Everyone gets a haircut one way or another. The wooly sheep are shorn. The black sheepdog is shorn at the same time, not a very fancy clip. She will scarcely be recognizable without her long curls, but they will grow back in time for winter and she will look herself again. Even the chickens molt. The rooster won't be himself until he can parade his fine tail feathers again. Even though it's cool and comfortable, it must be embarrassing to lose all your clothes all at once. Cats don't need clipping. They shed their coats on other people's clothes and furniture. The end. First page."
15,00:09:53,2021-05-26 16:47:39,Robot,That was a great story.
16,00:09:57,2021-05-26 16:47:43,Parent,Thank you.
17,00:09:57,2021-05-26 16:47:43,Robot,Want to read another one?
18,00:09:58,2021-05-26 16:47:44,Parent,"Alex, do you want to read another one? Why don't we, uh, go for a short story, yeah? Or do you want this book again?"
19,00:10:07,2021-05-26 16:47:53,Child,No.
20,00:10:13,2021-05-26 16:47:59,Parent,"Go back. These are short stories. The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, On the Farm, Farm Animals, My Five Senses, My Five Senses. That one? I have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, two ears and two hands. With my eyes I see myself, my shadow, my dog and my city. With my nose I smell popcorn, a horse, flowers, and garbage. With my mouth I taste watermelon, the ocean, medicine and ice cream. With my ears I hear my baby brother, a fire engine, my piano and whispered secrets. With my hands I feel finger paints, sand, water and a rabbit. With our five senses we enjoy our world. The end. [inaudible 00:12:19]. There's Rap A Tap Tap and that's it."
21,00:12:23,2021-05-26 16:50:09,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
22,00:12:36,2021-05-26 16:50:22,Parent,Okay.
23,00:12:37,2021-05-26 16:50:23,Robot,Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly.
24,00:12:43,2021-05-26 16:50:29,Parent,[inaudible 00:12:43].
25,00:12:42,2021-05-26 16:50:28,Robot,"Oh, and please complete the story survey and sign up for the next session. Thank you. Bye-bye."
