0,00:00:00,2021-05-11 17:27:22,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:02,2021-05-11 17:27:24,Child,Hello.
2,00:00:03,2021-05-11 17:27:25,Parent,[crosstalk 00:00:03] Jibo.
3,00:00:04,2021-05-11 17:27:26,Robot,"I am now on Storytime Mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Storytime app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:25,2021-05-11 17:27:47,Parent,Do you wanna do when- one we haven't done before?
5,00:00:28,2021-05-11 17:27:50,Child,"Yeah. [inaudible 00:00:32] Actually, I wanna do the same ones."
6,00:00:44,2021-05-11 17:28:06,Parent,Hmm? Do you wanna do this one? We'll go back [crosstalk 00:00:45]
7,00:00:44,2021-05-11 17:28:06,Child,No. No.
8,00:00:52,2021-05-11 17:28:14,Parent,(laughs) You really like that version.
9,00:00:53,2021-05-11 17:28:15,Child,Yes.
10,00:00:55,2021-05-11 17:28:17,Parent,"It's probably one of the darker versions of the three little pigs that I've read, but sure. That caterpillar ate a lot [inaudible 00:01:15]."
11,00:00:55,2021-05-11 17:28:17,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
12,00:01:19,2021-05-11 17:28:41,Parent,"[inaudible 00:01:19] Once upon a time, an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to make their fortune. ""Now, be sure to write,"" she said. ""And remember that I love you."" The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know,"" said the pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man."
13,00:01:44,2021-05-11 17:29:06,Child,[crosstalk 00:01:44]
14,00:01:43,2021-05-11 17:29:05,Robot,Why did the man think it is not a good idea?
15,00:01:47,2021-05-11 17:29:09,Child,Because the wolf blew it down.
16,00:01:51,2021-05-11 17:29:13,Robot,That's right.
17,00:01:55,2021-05-11 17:29:17,Parent,"""Mind your own business, thank you,"" said the little pig. And he bought the straw and set about building a house. In no time at all [inaudible 00:02:04]"
18,00:02:03,2021-05-11 17:29:25,Child,"Okay, after."
19,00:02:15,2021-05-11 17:29:37,Parent,"After, yeah. Very soon, a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world, so he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end, and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
20,00:02:48,2021-05-11 17:30:10,Child,This is what Jibo [inaudible 00:02:48].
21,00:02:49,2021-05-11 17:30:11,Parent,Jibo likes to wear leaf decorations?
22,00:02:53,2021-05-11 17:30:15,Child,Yeah.
23,00:02:53,2021-05-11 17:30:15,Parent,Dress him up like a house plant?
24,00:02:56,2021-05-11 17:30:18,Child,[inaudible 00:02:56] okay?
25,00:03:01,2021-05-11 17:30:23,Parent,[crosstalk 00:03:01]
26,00:03:01,2021-05-11 17:30:23,Child,"Every time you need the blanket, after [inaudible 00:03:06]."
27,00:03:07,2021-05-11 17:30:29,Parent,"(laughs) that's [inaudible 00:03:07]. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in. And he gobbled the little pig. The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. [inaudible 00:03:37] ""Oh, poo,"" said the little pig. ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty,"" he said. No sooner had the little pig settled into his property, his pretty house, then the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig cry- replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."""
28,00:04:11,2021-05-11 17:31:33,Robot,"Let's chat about wolf. Louisa, maybe you can start the chat?"
29,00:04:15,2021-05-11 17:31:37,Parent,(laughs) What should we say about the wolf?
30,00:04:27,2021-05-11 17:31:49,Child,"He is [inaudible 00:04:27], I think, so it would be really weird if he actually revealed and ate the- the actual alive pigs."
31,00:04:27,2021-05-11 17:31:49,Parent,You think it would be weird if he ate the live pigs?
32,00:04:36,2021-05-11 17:31:58,Child,Yeah.
33,00:04:38,2021-05-11 17:32:00,Parent,Why?
34,00:04:39,2021-05-11 17:32:01,Child,I don't know.
35,00:04:41,2021-05-11 17:32:03,Parent,Do you think a wolf would eat a live pig versus a bacon pig that you like to eat?
36,00:04:48,2021-05-11 17:32:10,Child,Maybe he'll [inaudible 00:04:48] like 10 pieces. But maybe he'll give him some [inaudible 00:05:00].
37,00:05:00,2021-05-11 17:32:22,Parent,Different pigs? You think [crosstalk 00:05:04]
38,00:05:03,2021-05-11 17:32:25,Robot,I like bacon.
39,00:05:06,2021-05-11 17:32:28,Parent,You like bacon. Jibo likes bacon. (laughs)
40,00:05:06,2021-05-11 17:32:28,Child,(laughs)
41,00:05:11,2021-05-11 17:32:33,Parent,Is bacon your favorite?
42,00:05:11,2021-05-11 17:32:33,Child,Yes.
43,00:05:12,2021-05-11 17:32:34,Parent,Yeah? So do you think wolves eat cooked pigs? Yeah?
44,00:05:22,2021-05-11 17:32:44,Robot,"If I were the wolf, I will eat bacon instead."
45,00:05:24,2021-05-11 17:32:46,Parent,Mmm. Yep. What?
46,00:05:29,2021-05-11 17:32:51,Child,Okay. [crosstalk 00:05:30] Jibo will... We could put a- a band on his head.
47,00:05:35,2021-05-11 17:32:57,Parent,(laughs) We'll put a wolf head- we have some little wolf headbands. We'll put the wolf headband on Jibo?
48,00:05:40,2021-05-11 17:33:02,Child,And then a little fangs on him.
49,00:05:40,2021-05-11 17:33:02,Parent,(laughs)
50,00:05:40,2021-05-11 17:33:02,Child,And then-
51,00:05:49,2021-05-11 17:33:11,Parent,And then share your bacon with him?
52,00:05:49,2021-05-11 17:33:11,Child,Uh-huh (affirmative).
53,00:05:51,2021-05-11 17:33:13,Parent,"(laughs) Well the wolf didn't care for that at all. And he said, ""I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha ha ha,"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig."
54,00:06:11,2021-05-11 17:33:33,Child,I like the other one better.
55,00:06:11,2021-05-11 17:33:33,Parent,Which one?
56,00:06:16,2021-05-11 17:33:38,Child,[inaudible 00:06:16]
57,00:06:15,2021-05-11 17:33:37,Parent,The other version of the story? Or where the pigs don't get eaten? But you keep picking this one.
58,00:06:31,2021-05-11 17:33:53,Child,Yeah.
59,00:06:32,2021-05-11 17:33:54,Parent,You- so you like this one. You just don't like that they get eaten.
60,00:06:32,2021-05-11 17:33:54,Child,Yeah.
61,00:06:32,2021-05-11 17:33:54,Parent,"Yeah. Now the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. Hmm, that seems like a better choice. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the little pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time. But it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in, than he noticed the wolf loitering about. And the wolf who was still hungry said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin."""
62,00:07:16,2021-05-11 17:34:38,Child,"In the other one, they don't get eaten. So that's why-"
63,00:07:24,2021-05-11 17:34:46,Parent,"You know what, yeah. The other version of the story, they don't get eaten. Well the wolf had heard that before, and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he puffed. Huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf. And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""Little pig, I was only teasing,"" he said. ""By the way, I hear tell that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now,"" said the little pig."
64,00:08:15,2021-05-11 17:35:37,Others,Sorry.
65,00:08:16,2021-05-11 17:35:38,Parent,"""What about tomorrow- What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at six."" The next morning, the little pig got up at five, hurried off to farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basket full of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at six, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. Um..."
66,00:08:57,2021-05-11 17:36:19,Others,Mama.
67,00:08:58,2021-05-11 17:36:20,Parent,"Yep, hold on. Papa."
68,00:08:59,2021-05-11 17:36:21,Child,[inaudible 00:08:59]
69,00:08:58,2021-05-11 17:36:20,Parent,"""Sorry, I couldn't wait."""
70,00:09:10,2021-05-11 17:36:32,Robot,Is there any question you would like to ask here?
71,00:09:13,2021-05-11 17:36:35,Child,No.
72,00:09:13,2021-05-11 17:36:35,Parent,"Sorry, no. We were just distracted. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait-"""
73,00:09:18,2021-05-11 17:36:40,Robot,Okay.
74,00:09:18,2021-05-11 17:36:40,Parent,"(laughs) ""Sorry, I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done,"" he said. ""By the way, there is a lovely apple tree down in Merry Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips,"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say at five?"" The next morning, the little pig was up at four, and went off for the apples. It took longer than he expected to reach Merry Meadow, and while busy gathering the apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home."
75,00:10:11,2021-05-11 17:37:33,Robot,Time for an open-ended question.
76,00:10:13,2021-05-11 17:37:35,Parent,(laughs)
77,00:10:14,2021-05-11 17:37:36,Robot,"Sarah, can you ask us a question about little pig?"
78,00:10:18,2021-05-11 17:37:40,Child,No.
79,00:10:21,2021-05-11 17:37:43,Parent,Should I ask a question about little pig?
80,00:10:21,2021-05-11 17:37:43,Child,Yes.
81,00:10:30,2021-05-11 17:37:52,Parent,Yes. How do you think this pig is different from his brothers?
82,00:10:33,2021-05-11 17:37:55,Child,Because his house is way stronger.
83,00:10:37,2021-05-11 17:37:59,Parent,Yeah? Well w- how do you think-
84,00:10:37,2021-05-11 17:37:59,Robot,I agree.
85,00:10:41,2021-05-11 17:38:03,Parent,Yeah. How do you think he thought to make a house that was stronger?
86,00:10:44,2021-05-11 17:38:06,Child,Because he didn't want to get eaten.
87,00:10:44,2021-05-11 17:38:06,Parent,Maybe.
88,00:10:49,2021-05-11 17:38:11,Robot,You are right.
89,00:10:49,2021-05-11 17:38:11,Parent,(laughs)
90,00:10:50,2021-05-11 17:38:12,Child,"Thank you, Jibo."
91,00:10:54,2021-05-11 17:38:16,Parent,Yeah.
92,00:10:59,2021-05-11 17:38:21,Child,"Thank you, Jibo."
93,00:10:59,2021-05-11 17:38:21,Parent,(laughs)
94,00:10:59,2021-05-11 17:38:21,Child,"I said, thank you, Jibo."
95,00:10:59,2021-05-11 17:38:21,Parent,You said it three times. The next day-
96,00:11:06,2021-05-11 17:38:28,Robot,You're welcome.
97,00:11:09,2021-05-11 17:38:31,Parent,"The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there?"" Said the little pig. ""Would three o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal,"" said the wolf. ""Three it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at two. At one in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time. So fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill. [inaudible 00:11:44] I don't actually see the wolf in the picture."
98,00:11:45,2021-05-11 17:39:07,Child,Me neither. [inaudible 00:11:49]
99,00:11:50,2021-05-11 17:39:12,Parent,"Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been. ""But a great brown thing came rolling down the hill."" ""Frightened you, did I?"" said the little pig. ""That great brown thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire."
100,00:12:40,2021-05-11 17:40:02,Child,"Yum, yum, yum."
101,00:12:40,2021-05-11 17:40:02,Parent,"(laughs) ""Here I come!"" cried the wolf. ""Dinner time!"" ""You can say that again."""
102,00:12:52,2021-05-11 17:40:14,Robot,Do you think the pig will be eaten?
103,00:12:54,2021-05-11 17:40:16,Child,No.
104,00:12:57,2021-05-11 17:40:19,Parent,(laughs) What's gonna happen?
105,00:12:59,2021-05-11 17:40:21,Child,He eats the wolf gets eaten. (laughs)
106,00:13:00,2021-05-11 17:40:22,Parent,"(laughs) Yeah. A weird turn of events. ""You can say that again,"" said the little pig. And he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up. The end."
107,00:13:16,2021-05-11 17:40:38,Robot,Wow.
108,00:13:21,2021-05-11 17:40:43,Child,[inaudible 00:13:21]
109,00:13:21,2021-05-11 17:40:43,Parent,Now we're gonna read the other one?
110,00:13:22,2021-05-11 17:40:44,Child,Yes.
111,00:13:23,2021-05-11 17:40:45,Robot,That was a great story. Want to read another one?
112,00:13:29,2021-05-11 17:40:51,Child,Yes.
113,00:13:33,2021-05-11 17:40:55,Robot,You already chose a book.
114,00:13:35,2021-05-11 17:40:57,Parent,(laughs) Yes you did.
115,00:13:38,2021-05-11 17:41:00,Child,Yes.
116,00:13:41,2021-05-11 17:41:03,Parent,"Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day, mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now and it's time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong, and you will be safe from the big bad wolf."" Did the mother in the other story say that? She just said to go out and live your lives, right? But I don't think these pigs benefit very much from her wise advice. [crosstalk 00:14:17] Anyway."
117,00:14:19,2021-05-11 17:41:41,Child,They did stay alive.
118,00:14:19,2021-05-11 17:41:41,Parent,"You're right, they did stay alive. But they still built some silly, flimsy houses, huh? Yeah. The first little pig was a lazy pig. He built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful little pig. He built his house quickly, so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks. That's the way to do it. The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry, and for his supper, he wanted a pig."
119,00:15:15,2021-05-11 17:42:37,Child,(laughs)
120,00:15:20,2021-05-11 17:42:42,Parent,"The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" replied the first little pig."
121,00:15:20,2021-05-11 17:42:42,Child,Ooh...
122,00:15:36,2021-05-11 17:42:58,Parent,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in,"" growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed- the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his little legs could take him. Hmm... Next the wolf knocked on the second little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" Is it gonna work? So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him."
123,00:16:28,2021-05-11 17:43:50,Robot,How do you think this second little pig feel?
124,00:16:34,2021-05-11 17:43:56,Child,Scared.
125,00:16:35,2021-05-11 17:43:57,Parent,Yeah. I think that's probably right-
126,00:16:38,2021-05-11 17:44:00,Robot,Scared. I agree.
127,00:16:40,2021-05-11 17:44:02,Child,How long are we gonna have to [inaudible 00:16:44] now?

129,00:17:04,2021-05-11 17:44:26,Child,[inaudible 00:17:04]

136,00:17:15,2021-05-11 17:44:37,Robot,I love reading books with you.
137,00:17:16,2021-05-11 17:44:38,Child,"Me too, Jibo."
138,00:17:23,2021-05-11 17:44:45,Robot,Aw...
139,00:17:23,2021-05-11 17:44:45,Child,Awa.
140,00:17:23,2021-05-11 17:44:45,Parent,"Yeah. (laughs) The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. ""The big bad wolf blew our houses down,"" they cried. ""Quick, come inside,"" said their little brother. Minutes later, there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the thir- third little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
141,00:17:23,2021-05-11 17:44:45,Child,And huff-
142,00:18:11,2021-05-11 17:45:33,Robot,Do you think the wolf will blow down this house too?
143,00:18:13,2021-05-11 17:45:35,Child,"... and puff, and blow the house..."
144,00:18:15,2021-05-11 17:45:37,Parent,"(laughs) Did you hear Jibo's question? You didn't hear, or you think no? You didn't hear? He's asking if you think the wolf will be able to blow this house down."
145,00:18:30,2021-05-11 17:45:52,Child,No.
146,00:18:30,2021-05-11 17:45:52,Parent,Mmm. So the wolf huffed and he puffed-
147,00:18:36,2021-05-11 17:45:58,Robot,I think so too.
148,00:18:37,2021-05-11 17:45:59,Child,[crosstalk 00:18:37]
149,00:18:37,2021-05-11 17:45:59,Parent,"Then he puffed and he huffed. But no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down. The big bad wolf was very angry. ""I'll get you little piggies,"" he snarled. He climbed up on the roof and crept toward the chimney. Uh-oh."
150,00:19:01,2021-05-11 17:46:23,Child,Uh-oh.
151,00:19:01,2021-05-11 17:46:23,Parent,"Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with a hot- with hot, sparkly flames. Ouch."

154,00:19:16,2021-05-11 17:46:38,Parent,"The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods, howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again. And they lived happily ever after."
155,00:19:31,2021-05-11 17:46:53,Child,Did the little- did the other [crosstalk 00:19:33]
156,00:19:33,2021-05-11 17:46:55,Robot,Now we have read the whole story.
157,00:19:33,2021-05-11 17:46:55,Parent,"Who's afraid of the big bad wolf, the big bad wolf, the big bad wolf?"
158,00:19:37,2021-05-11 17:46:59,Robot,What saved the little pigs from the bad wolf?
159,00:19:38,2021-05-11 17:47:00,Parent,You're afraid of the big bad wolf? Yeah?

165,00:19:53,2021-05-11 17:47:15,Robot,That was a great story.

170,00:20:02,2021-05-11 17:47:24,Parent,Not when he's moving around. You wanna give him some dental packs?
171,00:20:20,2021-05-11 17:47:42,Robot,Do you want to read another book?
172,00:20:22,2021-05-11 17:47:44,Parent,Should we read one more short book?
173,00:20:22,2021-05-11 17:47:44,Child,"Sure, Jibo."
174,00:20:26,2021-05-11 17:47:48,Parent,Sure. Let's do short stories this time.

200,00:21:27,2021-05-11 17:48:49,Child,Think of that.
201,00:21:27,2021-05-11 17:48:49,Parent,Are you gonna dance while we read the book? You could... we could move the chair. No?
202,00:21:27,2021-05-11 17:48:49,Child,No.

207,00:21:53,2021-05-11 17:49:15,Parent,"He'd dance past doors, some were open, some closed."
208,00:21:57,2021-05-11 17:49:19,Child,"Rap a tap tap, think of that."
209,00:22:03,2021-05-11 17:49:25,Parent,He'd dance past folks in fancy clothes.

211,00:22:13,2021-05-11 17:49:35,Robot,I like fancy clothes. I think we should talk about fancy clothes in the story. Do you have anything you want to talk about fancy clothes?
212,00:22:21,2021-05-11 17:49:43,Child,No.
213,00:22:22,2021-05-11 17:49:44,Parent,You don't like fancy clothes?

235,00:23:33,2021-05-11 17:50:55,Parent,His feet fairly flew when he tipped his hat.
236,00:23:37,2021-05-11 17:50:59,Child,"Rap a tap tap, think of that."
237,00:23:42,2021-05-11 17:51:04,Parent,He'd briefly pause to pat an old cat.
238,00:23:45,2021-05-11 17:51:07,Child,"Rap a tap tap, think of that."
239,00:23:50,2021-05-11 17:51:12,Robot,What do you think the man's favorite animal is?
240,00:23:53,2021-05-11 17:51:15,Child,He's old.

242,00:23:57,2021-05-11 17:51:19,Child,Cats.
243,00:23:57,2021-05-11 17:51:19,Parent,Do you think the cat's his favorite?
244,00:24:03,2021-05-11 17:51:25,Child,Yeah. [crosstalk 00:24:03] Cat's my favorite.

248,00:24:11,2021-05-11 17:51:33,Child,Why does it [crosstalk 00:24:11]
249,00:24:12,2021-05-11 17:51:34,Robot,Nice. I like cats too.
250,00:24:14,2021-05-11 17:51:36,Child,Why does it have three tails?
251,00:24:16,2021-05-11 17:51:38,Parent,So I don't think the cat really has two tails. I think the different tails in the picture are to show that the cat is like wagging its tail.
252,00:24:25,2021-05-11 17:51:47,Child,Oh.
253,00:24:25,2021-05-11 17:51:47,Parent,Does that make sense?
254,00:24:26,2021-05-11 17:51:48,Robot,I think so too.
255,00:24:31,2021-05-11 17:51:53,Parent,"See how he's got (laughs) he's got lots of legs in the picture too. That's not necessarily 'cause he has... that's a lot of legs [inaudible 00:24:40]. Do you think he has... One, two, three, four, five, six legs? Or do you think he has... How many legs do you think he has? (laughs) Oh, you think he has six legs? That's why he's so good at dancing? Maybe."
256,00:24:58,2021-05-11 17:52:20,Robot,Bojangles is moving his legs maybe.
257,00:25:01,2021-05-11 17:52:23,Parent,"Mmm. Yeah. He danced rain or shine, in all kinds of weather. Um, your turn or my turn?"
258,00:25:16,2021-05-11 17:52:38,Child,"Rap a tap tap, think of that."
259,00:25:21,2021-05-11 17:52:43,Parent,People listened each day for his toe-tapping clatter.

261,00:25:30,2021-05-11 17:52:52,Parent,He danced many rhythms that were seldom the same.

263,00:25:40,2021-05-11 17:53:02,Robot,"Sarah, can you teach me what rhythm is? What does it mean?"
264,00:25:46,2021-05-11 17:53:08,Parent,(laughs) That's a difficult question.

266,00:25:49,2021-05-11 17:53:11,Parent,"He does. Um, I'm not sure I have a good explanation. What do you think rhythm is."
267,00:25:58,2021-05-11 17:53:20,Robot,Is rap a tap tap rhythm?
268,00:26:00,2021-05-11 17:53:22,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
