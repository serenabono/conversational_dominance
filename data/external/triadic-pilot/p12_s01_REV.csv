0,00:00:00,2021-06-01 16:30:29,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:00,2021-06-01 16:30:29,Parent,Hi.
2,00:00:02,2021-06-01 16:30:31,Child,Hi.
3,00:00:04,2021-06-01 16:30:33,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:24,2021-06-01 16:30:53,Parent,"Choose the book [inaudible 00:00:31]. This is Rap A Tap Tap [inaudible 00:00:38]. This is Farm Animals on the Farm, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, My Five Senses, My Five Senses. The rooster crows and struts. He's got feathers. He's got guts. Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows. The cow makes milk, standing, grazing. Abracadabra. She's utterly amazing. The pony whinnies in the winds, kicks in his stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall."
5,00:01:34,2021-06-01 16:32:03,Robot,Why do you think he kicks his stall?
6,00:01:35,2021-06-01 16:32:04,Parent,"I think that's a question for you. Why does he ki-, why does he kick his stall? [inaudible 00:01:42] Jibo."
7,00:01:42,2021-06-01 16:32:11,Child,[inaudible 00:01:42].
8,00:01:41,2021-06-01 16:32:10,Parent,"Ask Jibo then, say, ""I don't know what that means."""
9,00:01:50,2021-06-01 16:32:19,Child,"I don't know what that means. Hey, Jibo."
10,00:02:01,2021-06-01 16:32:30,Robot,Why do you think he kicks his stall?
11,00:02:06,2021-06-01 16:32:35,Parent,"So, so, kicking his stall is like, what he's doing. He's using his back legs to kick his stall. Why do you think he's doing that?"
12,00:02:16,2021-06-01 16:32:45,Child,[crosstalk 00:02:16].
13,00:02:16,2021-06-01 16:32:45,Parent,[inaudible 00:02:16].
14,00:02:15,2021-06-01 16:32:44,Child,"To, to be with his mommy."
15,00:02:17,2021-06-01 16:32:46,Parent,"The dog sleeps with one eve open in the shady farmhouse yard. You might think he's keeping cool. Beware, he's keeping guard. The sheep began his wooly life as gentle as a lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram. Bam. So, if you don't understand, you need to ask me. Okay? The barn cat, mice had better think twice. The goat eats everything from trash to [inaudible 00:03:11]. Hey, look out. He'll knock you silly. When he's bad, we call him William. When he's good, he's just our Billy. The pig, her tail as coy as a ringlet. In her eye, there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow. I see a beauty queen. The snake coils in the garden like a spring [inaudible 00:03:44] a winding melody, he hears [inaudible 00:03:52]. The bees tell their story, sweet and old. It becan- begins in clover. It end with gold."
16,00:04:03,2021-06-01 16:34:32,Robot,"Jenny, do you know what bees make?"
17,00:04:12,2021-06-01 16:34:41,Parent,[inaudible 00:04:12] honey.
18,00:04:13,2021-06-01 16:34:42,Robot,Wonderful.
19,00:04:13,2021-06-01 16:34:42,Child,Honey.
20,00:04:19,2021-06-01 16:34:48,Parent,"The bull knows what he likes, cows and corn, knows what he is, muscle and horn. The turtle lifts her [inaudible 00:04:32] head and blinks, one, two, three times ... One, two, three times in the awful light. In her house, it's always night. The duck quacks. The hen squawks. The goose [inaudible 00:04:50]. But the rabbit listens, listens, listens and doesn't make a sound. The end."
21,00:05:04,2021-06-01 16:35:33,Robot,Maybe we can talk about rabbit.
22,00:05:06,2021-06-01 16:35:35,Parent,[inaudible 00:05:06]. You wanna talk about rabbit?
23,00:05:13,2021-06-01 16:35:42,Child,Yes.
24,00:05:15,2021-06-01 16:35:44,Robot,Any questions? Any questions about the rabbit?
25,00:05:33,2021-06-01 16:36:02,Child,Why do rabbits eat carrots?
26,00:05:51,2021-06-01 16:36:20,Robot,Nice. Do you know? Can you teach me?
27,00:05:56,2021-06-01 16:36:25,Parent,"Do you know why rabbits eat carrots, [Alex 00:06:01]?"
28,00:06:01,2021-06-01 16:36:30,Child,"Because, because [inaudible 00:06:01]."
29,00:06:01,2021-06-01 16:36:30,Parent,Rabbits are orange. [inaudible 00:06:01] carrots that are orange. And it's very tasty.
30,00:06:17,2021-06-01 16:36:46,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
31,00:06:18,2021-06-01 16:36:47,Parent,"Well, I think rabbits eat many things. But it's just known that they like carrots. Yeah? [inaudible 00:06:26]. Okay. Do you wanna pick another book?"
32,00:06:31,2021-06-01 16:37:00,Robot,Thank you.
33,00:06:31,2021-06-01 16:37:00,Parent,"You want a short story or a long story? This is Geraldine, The Music Mouse. This is the one we read last time, Three Billy Goats [Grutt 00:06:54], The Little Red Hen, The Little Red Hen. Three Billy Goats Gruff. And then The Year at Maple Hill Farm, The Three Little Pigs, The Year at Maple Hill Farm. Well, this is fall, spring, and summer. We read [inaudible 00:07:13]. Three Little Pigs. And that's it. You pick one. I'll be right back."
34,00:06:31,2021-06-01 16:37:00,Child,This one.
35,00:07:23,2021-06-01 16:37:52,Parent,"Okay, pick it. Geraldine, The Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes, many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. And of course, the soft [inaudible 00:07:57] of mice. But music, never. Then one morning, in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered a enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give you, each of you ... I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends who loved cheese happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said. And off they went."
36,00:08:51,2021-06-01 16:39:20,Robot,Why did Geraldine ask her friends to help?
37,00:08:58,2021-06-01 16:39:27,Child,Because it was too heavy.
38,00:09:01,2021-06-01 16:39:30,Robot,Bravo.
39,00:09:03,2021-06-01 16:39:32,Parent,"""It's enormous. It's gigantic. It's immense. It's fantastic,"" they shouted with joy when they saw piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled, and tugged. And finally, they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it and pulled away, crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese to bits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the shape of two enormous ears, cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden, of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse."
40,00:10:27,2021-06-01 16:40:56,Robot,Is there any question you would like to ask here?
41,00:10:32,2021-06-01 16:41:01,Child,No.
42,00:10:34,2021-06-01 16:41:03,Parent,"Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clear and more melo- melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air, like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music,"" she thought, ""This must be music."" She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty windowpanes. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play, play,"" Geraldine begged, ""Play some more."" But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought, as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies. And even in daylight, they lingered in her ears."
43,00:12:31,2021-06-01 16:43:00,Robot,What does gobbled mean?
44,00:12:35,2021-06-01 16:43:04,Parent,"What does, um, gobbled [inaudible 00:12:43]. Say that again."
45,00:12:47,2021-06-01 16:43:16,Child,What does gobbled mean?
46,00:12:51,2021-06-01 16:43:20,Robot,What does gobbled mean?
47,00:12:51,2021-06-01 16:43:20,Parent,What does it mean?
48,00:12:56,2021-06-01 16:43:25,Child,[inaudible 00:12:56].
49,00:12:58,2021-06-01 16:43:27,Parent,[inaudible 00:12:58].
50,00:12:59,2021-06-01 16:43:28,Child,"Gob- gobble, gobble-"
51,00:13:02,2021-06-01 16:43:31,Parent,She gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around.
52,00:13:06,2021-06-01 16:43:35,Child,"Gobble cheese, gobble the cheese."
53,00:13:11,2021-06-01 16:43:40,Parent,"Then one day, she met her friend on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food. And there is none to be found anywhere. You will share your cheese with us."" ""But that is not possible, "" ""Why?"" asked the others, angrily. ""Because, because it is music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" They asked all together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath, and blew. She blew hard. She [inaudible 00:13:58]. She [inaudible 00:13:59]. She [inaudible 00:14:00]. She squeaked. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. Then a long, soft, beautiful wisser- whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine, joyfully, ""Now, we can eat the cheese because now, the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn."
54,00:14:55,2021-06-01 16:45:24,Robot,"Hey, [Alexandre 00:14:57]. Why can they eat the cheese now?"
55,00:15:02,2021-06-01 16:45:31,Child,"Because the, the mice want ... The mice knew how to, how to, how to wis- ... How to do a song. So, because all the other mice wanted to, to eat it, so [inaudible 00:15:24] ate it because Geraldine knew how to, how to do the music."
56,00:15:32,2021-06-01 16:46:01,Parent,Good.
57,00:15:32,2021-06-01 16:46:01,Robot,Awesome.
58,00:15:34,2021-06-01 16:46:03,Parent,"And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. The end. You wanna keep on going or are we done?"
59,00:15:50,2021-06-01 16:46:19,Child,Done.
60,00:15:52,2021-06-01 16:46:21,Parent,"We're done? Oh, well, you have to ask, um, Jibo. Maybe you want a short story instead. [inaudible 00:16:00] short story."
61,00:16:07,2021-06-01 16:46:36,Child,Yes. [inaudible 00:16:08].
62,00:16:09,2021-06-01 16:46:38,Robot,Do you want to read another one?
63,00:16:10,2021-06-01 16:46:39,Parent,Talk to him.
64,00:16:23,2021-06-01 16:46:52,Child,Yes. [inaudible 00:16:23].
65,00:16:23,2021-06-01 16:46:52,Parent,"[inaudible 00:16:23]. No, no, no, short story. Let's do a short story. Do Rap a Tap Tap. There once was a man who danced in the street. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He brought pleasure and joy to the people he'd greet. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He didn't just dance, he made art with his feet. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He danced past doors; some were open, some closed. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He danced past folks in fancy clothes. Rap a tap tap, think of that! He danced through a place people called the skids. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He danced through crowds of laughing kids. Rap a tap tap, think of that."
66,00:17:33,2021-06-01 16:48:02,Robot,Could you please ask us a open-ended question about Rap A Tap Tap?
67,00:17:45,2021-06-01 16:48:14,Child,"What, why does he dance, uh, everywhere?"
68,00:17:51,2021-06-01 16:48:20,Robot,You need to guess. Good question.
69,00:17:59,2021-06-01 16:48:28,Child,Because he likes dancing?
70,00:18:00,2021-06-01 16:48:29,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Good. His feet fairly flew as he tipped his hat. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He briefly paused to pat an old cat. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He danced rain or shine, in all kinds of weather. Rap a tap tap, think of that. People listened each day for his toe-tapping clatter. Rap a tap tap, think of that. He danced many rhythms that were seldom the same. Rap a tap tap, think of that. Dance was his passion, and it brought him fame. Rap a tap tap, think of that. Bojangles, Bojangles, that was his name. Rap a tap tap, think of that."
71,00:19:06,2021-06-01 16:49:35,Robot,"Now that we have read the book, I learned some things about Bojangles. I learned that he likes to tap dance. Do you remember anything about Bojangles?"
72,00:19:18,2021-06-01 16:49:47,Child,[inaudible 00:19:18].
73,00:19:17,2021-06-01 16:49:46,Parent,Bojangle was the guy's name? What do you remember about the book?
74,00:19:23,2021-06-01 16:49:52,Child,He danced a lot.
75,00:19:29,2021-06-01 16:49:58,Robot,Yes. Anything else?
76,00:19:39,2021-06-01 16:50:08,Child,No.
77,00:19:40,2021-06-01 16:50:09,Robot,That is fine.
78,00:20:00,2021-06-01 16:50:29,Parent,"[inaudible 00:20:00] we're done then, unless you wanna read more."
79,00:20:03,2021-06-01 16:50:32,Robot,That was a great story.
80,00:20:04,2021-06-01 16:50:33,Parent,(laughs).
81,00:20:07,2021-06-01 16:50:36,Robot,That's it for today's session.
82,00:20:10,2021-06-01 16:50:39,Parent,Thank you.
83,00:20:10,2021-06-01 16:50:39,Robot,I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
84,00:20:16,2021-06-01 16:50:45,Parent,Bye-bye.
85,00:20:16,2021-06-01 16:50:45,Robot,"[crosstalk 00:20:16] take me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to [inaudible 00:20:21] shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey and sign up for the next session. Thank you, bye-bye."
