31,00:03:03,2021-07-01 08:09:57,Parent,"Hmm, poor troll. He probably didn't want to be mean."
32,00:03:05,2021-07-01 08:09:59,Child,"The youngest billy goat was decided to cross the bridge. Trip, trap, trip, trap said the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Said the troll."

54,00:08:03,2021-07-01 08:14:57,Child,Do you think see this?
55,00:08:06,2021-07-01 08:15:00,Parent,I don't think so.

57,00:08:10,2021-07-01 08:15:04,Parent,Okay.
58,00:08:15,2021-07-01 08:15:09,Child,[inaudible 00:08:15].
59,00:08:15,2021-07-01 08:15:09,Parent,"Okay, you can do this one."
60,00:08:15,2021-07-01 08:15:09,Child,You read.
61,00:08:18,2021-07-01 08:15:12,Parent,I should read it this time?
62,00:08:22,2021-07-01 08:15:16,Child,Yeah.
63,00:08:23,2021-07-01 08:15:17,Parent,"The Little Red Hen. One summer day the little red hen found a grain of wheat. ""A grain of wheat,"" said the little red hen to herself, ""I will plant it."" She asked the duck, ""will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. Quack, quack, quack. She asked the goose, ""will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the geese. She asked the cat, ""will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Meow, not I,"" said the cat. She asked the pig, ""will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""(Snorts) not I,"" said the pig. Look at the pig. He's got a nice picnic."
64,00:09:03,2021-07-01 08:15:57,Child,She.
65,00:09:04,2021-07-01 08:15:58,Parent,"It's a she pig? How do you know it's a she? She is the chicken TT. ""Then I will plant it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. Soon the wheat grew tall and little red hen knew it was time to reap it. ""Who..."" Do you know what reap means TT?"
66,00:09:25,2021-07-01 08:16:19,Child,Cut it down.
67,00:09:26,2021-07-01 08:16:20,Parent,"Cut it down. ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" She asked. Kind of harvest it too. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. What are they playing?"
68,00:09:38,2021-07-01 08:16:32,Child,Probably knights.
69,00:09:40,2021-07-01 08:16:34,Parent,"Knights, yeah. Knight and soldier. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""(Snorts) not I,"" said the pig. ""Ah then I will reap it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour. ""Who will help me carry the wheat to the mill?"" She asked. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I (snorts),"" said the pig. (Sighs). ""Then I will carry it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. She carried the wheat to the mill and the miller made it into flour. That look very heavy to carry? Really? Talking about one grain of taking grass. When she got it home she asked, ""who will help me make the flour into dough?"" ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. ""Not I,"" said the cat. Oink, oink, oink (snorts). ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Then I will make the dough myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did."
70,00:10:52,2021-07-01 08:17:46,Parent,"Soon the bread was ready to go into the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" Said the little red hen. ""Not I,"" said the duck. ""Not I,"" said the goose. They're still playing the soldiers and pirates. ""Not I,"" said the cat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. He's still playing his violin. ""Then I will bake it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. After the loaf had been taken fro-, away from the oven it was set on the windowsill to cool. ""And now,"" said the little red hen, ""who will help me eat the bread?"" ""I will,"" said the duck. ""I will,"" said the geese. ""I will,"" said the cat. ""(Snorts) I will,"" said the pig. ""No, I will eat it myself,"" said the little red hen, and she did. Do you think she should have shared with her friends?"
71,00:11:47,2021-07-01 08:18:41,Child,No.
72,00:11:49,2021-07-01 08:18:43,Parent,Do you think her friends should have helped her?
73,00:11:50,2021-07-01 08:18:44,Child,Yes.
74,00:11:53,2021-07-01 08:18:47,Parent,"Do you think she could have asked for help in a better way than just saying, ""who will help me?"" If she really needed their help she said, ""friends can you help me please?"" What do you think she should have done."
75,00:12:07,2021-07-01 08:19:01,Child,Help.
76,00:12:09,2021-07-01 08:19:03,Parent,"Yeah. All right. Choose another story. Um, summer. Do you want to read about summer at the farm? Did you read about summer at the farm?"
77,00:12:25,2021-07-01 08:19:19,Child,No.
78,00:12:25,2021-07-01 08:19:19,Parent,That's a good one.
79,00:12:25,2021-07-01 08:19:19,Child,More books.
80,00:12:40,2021-07-01 08:19:34,Parent,"There click it. Hmm. Oh, it went back. These are your choices. Summer at the farm. I don't think we read the summer one. I think we've read the spring and the f-, fall."
81,00:12:47,2021-07-01 08:19:41,Child,Wow. Which one did we read? This one or this one?
82,00:12:53,2021-07-01 08:19:47,Parent,"Um, I think we read this one. So I don't think we read that one."
83,00:12:54,2021-07-01 08:19:48,Child,"No, no, no this one."
84,00:12:57,2021-07-01 08:19:51,Parent,"Are you sure? Let's see. Let's see, let's see."
85,00:12:58,2021-07-01 08:19:52,Child,Cause I remember this guy.
86,00:12:58,2021-07-01 08:19:52,Parent,Oh you remember that guy?
87,00:12:58,2021-07-01 08:19:52,Child,No. This.
88,00:13:07,2021-07-01 08:20:01,Parent,Once upon a time an old sow... Do you know what a sow is?
89,00:13:09,2021-07-01 08:20:03,Child,Girl pig.
90,00:13:12,2021-07-01 08:20:06,Parent,Girl pig. Sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. Do you know what seek means?
91,00:13:19,2021-07-01 08:20:13,Child,It means find.
92,00:13:20,2021-07-01 08:20:14,Parent,"Look for. You know the game hide and seek? Somebody hides and somebody does the looking for. Uh, to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write,"" she said, ""and remember that I love you."" Is she crying? Poor sad mama pig. The first pig met a man with a lot of straw. ""I know,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man. ""Mind your own business and thank you,"" said the little pig and he bought the straw and set about the building a house. It took him no time at all. Seems a little dangerous that guy. But it's a beautiful house. Would you like that house?"
93,00:14:06,2021-07-01 08:21:00,Child,Yeah.
94,00:14:09,2021-07-01 08:21:03,Parent,Very soon a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world so he knocked on the door and said... Do you want to be the wolf?
95,00:14:22,2021-07-01 08:21:16,Child,"Yeah. ""Now open little pig. Let me come in."""
96,00:14:24,2021-07-01 08:21:18,Parent,"To which the pig replied, ""no, no, no. Not by the hair on my chinny, chin, chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said..."
97,00:14:40,2021-07-01 08:21:34,Child,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down."""
98,00:14:40,2021-07-01 08:21:34,Parent,"""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So the wolf puffed and he puffed and he blew the house and then he gobbled up the little pig. (Gasps). Do you remember that part? Does he usually gobble up the pig or does he usually go to his brother's house?"
99,00:14:54,2021-07-01 08:21:48,Child,The pig comes to his brother's house [inaudible 00:14:59].
100,00:15:00,2021-07-01 08:21:54,Parent,"Uh, the second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said the little pig, ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""Uh, I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. ""Oh pew,"" said the little pig, ""what would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went about to work building a house. ""Very pretty,"" he said. Look at that. He's kind of like an acrobatic pig. Kind of flying. No sooner had the pig-"
101,00:15:30,2021-07-01 08:22:24,Child,Whoa.
102,00:15:30,2021-07-01 08:22:24,Parent,"Settled into his pretty house... It's on stilts. That's kind of interesting. Seems a maybe safe. Uh, then the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said... What does the wolf say?"
103,00:15:48,2021-07-01 08:22:42,Child,"""Little pig, little pig [inaudible 00:15:48]."""
104,00:15:49,2021-07-01 08:22:43,Parent,"To which the pig replied, ""no, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all and he said..."
105,00:15:58,2021-07-01 08:22:52,Child,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
106,00:16:10,2021-07-01 08:23:04,Parent,"""Ha, ha, ha,"" said the little pig. So the wold huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in and he gobbled up the little pig. Now the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea my fellow,"" said the little pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig, ""nice and solid."""
107,00:16:39,2021-07-01 08:23:33,Child,[inaudible 00:16:39].
108,00:16:40,2021-07-01 08:23:34,Parent,That's a lovely house. What do you think?
109,00:16:43,2021-07-01 08:23:37,Child,"Yeah, lovely."
110,00:16:45,2021-07-01 08:23:39,Parent,Lovely. But no sooner had the little pig moved in then he noticed the wolf loitering about. Do you know what loitering means? Want to ask Jibo?
111,00:16:52,2021-07-01 08:23:46,Child,Hey Jibo. Jibo. Hey Jibo what does loitering mean?
112,00:16:53,2021-07-01 08:23:47,Robot,(Sound effect). Yes. (Sound effect).
113,00:17:06,2021-07-01 08:24:00,Parent,Ask again.
114,00:17:06,2021-07-01 08:24:00,Robot,What was the wolf doing outside of the third pig's house?
115,00:17:09,2021-07-01 08:24:03,Parent,"Mm. Yeah, what does that mean loitering?"
116,00:17:13,2021-07-01 08:24:07,Robot,Loitering.
117,00:17:13,2021-07-01 08:24:07,Child,What us loitering?
118,00:17:24,2021-07-01 08:24:18,Parent,Loitering means just standing out there doing nothing much. Just hanging around out there. So he noticed the wolf loitering about and the wolf who was still hungry said...
119,00:17:38,2021-07-01 08:24:32,Child,"""Ah, little pig, little pig let me come in."""
120,00:17:46,2021-07-01 08:24:40,Parent,"To which the pig replied, ""no, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" Then the wolf had heard that before and he said..."
121,00:17:55,2021-07-01 08:24:49,Child,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
122,00:18:02,2021-07-01 08:24:56,Parent,"""Oh don't do that,"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. WHat's he saying now?"
123,00:18:13,2021-07-01 08:25:07,Child,"""I'll try another puff."""
124,00:18:17,2021-07-01 08:25:11,Parent,Muttered the wolf. And he put on his most dazzling smile. [inaudible 00:18:25]. L-
125,00:18:27,2021-07-01 08:25:21,Child,"""Little pig I was only teasing."""
126,00:18:32,2021-07-01 08:25:26,Parent,He said.

Oops. When the wolf arrived at six the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wold tried not to show his displeasure. Ready? You, this is your wolf."

144,00:20:02,2021-07-01 08:26:56,Parent,"It's quite early in the morning. The next morning the little pig was up at four and went off for the tr-, apple. It took longer than he expected to reach Merry Meadow. And while gathering apples in the highest tree he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. Do you know what shimmied means? Do you want to ask Jibo?"
145,00:20:28,2021-07-01 08:27:22,Child,Hey Jibo what does shimmy mean?
146,00:20:36,2021-07-01 08:27:30,Parent,Shimmy. Shimmy.

151,00:20:53,2021-07-01 08:27:47,Robot,(Sound effect). One moment.
152,00:20:55,2021-07-01 08:27:49,Child,I don't know.
153,00:21:06,2021-07-01 08:28:00,Robot,Watch something or fill up a space with a shim.
154,00:21:11,2021-07-01 08:28:05,Parent,"Hmm. Yeah, shimmy can mean kind of like move down like this (sings). So you can shimmy when you dance or you can shimmy when you come down a tree. Um, he shimmied down the tree."
155,00:21:23,2021-07-01 08:28:17,Robot,(Sound effect). Think about how you would get down from a tree. Can you shimmy?
156,00:21:27,2021-07-01 08:28:21,Parent,"Show him how you shimmy TT. It's, uh, you don't shake your head as much when you shimmy."

158,00:21:36,2021-07-01 08:28:30,Parent,(Laughs). The next day the wolf came again. Really he was quite put out. You are the wolf.

161,00:22:08,2021-07-01 08:29:02,Child,"""Colossal,"" said the wolf."
162,00:22:08,2021-07-01 08:29:02,Parent,This is the wolf.

164,00:22:16,2021-07-01 08:29:10,Parent,"Just to make sure he would be there at two. At one in the afternoon the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time, so fun that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly out of the corner of his eye he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare the little pig jumped inside of an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well the wolf was so scared he ran all the way home. That evening the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great, round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you did I?"" Said the little pig, ""that great, round thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. What did the wolf say?"

When the little pig saw this he put a big iron pot in the fire place then he started the fire. ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf, ""dinner time."" ""You can say that again,"" said the little pig. He cooked the mean, old wolf and gobbled him up."
168,00:23:44,2021-07-01 08:30:38,Parent,What? Who's the bad guy in this?
169,00:23:49,2021-07-01 08:30:43,Child,The wolf.
170,00:23:50,2021-07-01 08:30:44,Parent,Are you sure the pig? He kind of gobbled the bad guy up at the end.
171,00:23:53,2021-07-01 08:30:47,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
172,00:23:54,2021-07-01 08:30:48,Parent,Is it nice to eat your friends or your enemies?

180,00:24:18,2021-07-01 08:31:12,Parent,"Yeah, let's not eat our friends."
