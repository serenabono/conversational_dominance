Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. [crosstalk 00:00:26]. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
1,00:00:28,2021-05-03 18:31:31,Child,"Press them. Can you press them both? Or me? Can you sit all the way on your bum? [crosstalk 00:00:42] All right, what are we doing this time? We've got-"
2,00:00:45,2021-05-03 18:31:48,Child,Voom.
3,00:00:47,2021-05-03 18:31:50,Parent,"Voom? We're doing Voom, more books. So, do you wanna try The Little Puffin King? Three little pigs? That one?"
4,00:01:02,2021-05-03 18:32:05,Child,And then the other book.
5,00:01:07,2021-05-03 18:32:10,Parent,"Do you know about two little pigs? Wait, what's happening? Are you gonna practice some more?"
6,00:01:10,2021-05-03 18:32:13,Hayem,Yes.
7,00:01:10,2021-05-03 18:32:13,Parent,"Well, we're gonna have to take a pause until you... Like, can you, Hayem, get your, get your guitar and go back into the... Well, remember the rules about this, right? You just need..."
8,00:01:10,2021-05-03 18:32:13,Hayem,"Okay, shits."
9,00:01:10,2021-05-03 18:32:13,Parent,Okay.
10,00:01:10,2021-05-03 18:32:13,Hayem,"No, mama."
11,00:01:41,2021-05-03 18:32:44,Parent,Oh. All right. Three little pigs.
12,00:01:42,2021-05-03 18:32:45,Speaker 5,I haven't read much about [inaudible 00:01:50].
13,00:01:42,2021-05-03 18:32:45,Child,Three little pigs.
14,00:01:49,2021-05-03 18:32:52,Parent,Do you think this one will be different from the other one that you read?
15,00:01:49,2021-05-03 18:32:52,Child,Yes.
16,00:01:51,2021-05-03 18:32:54,Parent,What do you think is going to be different?
17,00:01:51,2021-05-03 18:32:54,Child,Him eating.
18,00:01:56,2021-05-03 18:32:59,Parent,"Oh yeah, they are eating right now. [crosstalk 00:01:58]. (laughs). Do you see what book he's reading? It's called The Three..."
19,00:02:05,2021-05-03 18:33:08,Child,Little Pigs.
20,00:02:06,2021-05-03 18:33:09,Parent,"(laughs). Actually, no, it's called The Three Bears. Do you know any stories about three bears?"
21,00:02:11,2021-05-03 18:33:14,Child,Yeah. Mister You Red.
22,00:02:16,2021-05-03 18:33:19,Parent,"Yeah? Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day, mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now. It's time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong and you will be safe from the big bad wolf."" The first little pig was a lazy, little pig. He built the simplest kind of house, so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful, little pig. He built his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks. The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big, bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry. And for his supper, he wanted a..."
23,00:02:16,2021-05-03 18:33:19,Child,Pig.
24,00:03:30,2021-05-03 18:34:33,Parent,"(laughs). The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."", he roared. ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."""
25,00:03:39,2021-05-03 18:34:42,Child,(laughs)
26,00:03:42,2021-05-03 18:34:45,Parent,"Oh, it's pretty scary, huh?"
27,00:03:42,2021-05-03 18:34:45,Child,"Oh, I'm scared."
28,00:03:48,2021-05-03 18:34:51,Parent,"Replied the first little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."", growled the wolf. So, the wolf howled and puffed, and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. That's one thing that's different, huh? Do you remember what happened to the pig in the other book? You remember?"
29,00:03:48,2021-05-03 18:34:51,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative)
30,00:04:21,2021-05-03 18:35:24,Parent,"Next the wolf knocked on the second pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."", he roared. ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."", said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So, the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. The third little pig heard a knock at his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. Do you remember what happened to the other pigs? In the first book?"
31,00:05:09,2021-05-03 18:36:12,Child,Ah.
32,00:05:11,2021-05-03 18:36:14,Parent,"(laughs). Yeah. That was the first time I think I'd seen that particular, uh, version. ""The big bad wolf blew our houses down."", they cried. ""Quick, come inside."", said their brother. Minutes later, there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."", said the thir, third little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."""
33,00:05:44,2021-05-03 18:36:47,Hayem,Do it like this?
34,00:05:44,2021-05-03 18:36:47,Parent,"So, the wolf howled, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed. But no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down."
35,00:05:59,2021-05-03 18:37:02,Child,Jing.
36,00:06:02,2021-05-03 18:37:05,Parent,"The big bad wolf was very angry. ""I'll get you, little piggies."", he snarled. Whoops. He climbed up on the roof, and crept toward the chimney [crosstalk 00:06:16]. Um, can you guys zip?"
37,00:06:16,2021-05-03 18:37:19,Child,Pipe down.
38,00:06:27,2021-05-03 18:37:30,Parent,"(laughs). Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney, and was met with a hot, with hot, crackling flames. ""Ouch."""
39,00:06:27,2021-05-03 18:37:30,Child,Ouchee. Ouchee. Ouchee.
40,00:06:43,2021-05-03 18:37:46,Parent,The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again. And they lived happily ever after. Hmm. [inaudible 00:06:54]?
41,00:06:54,2021-05-03 18:37:57,Child,Hmm. Hugging each other now.
42,00:06:55,2021-05-03 18:37:58,Parent,Yeah. Chocolate? Do you think they're happy to be alive?
43,00:07:14,2021-05-03 18:38:17,Child,I think they're-
44,00:07:14,2021-05-03 18:38:17,Parent,(laughs)
45,00:07:14,2021-05-03 18:38:17,Child,... are eaten by the wolf.
46,00:07:21,2021-05-03 18:38:24,Parent,"It's entirely possible, Louisa."
47,00:07:22,2021-05-03 18:38:25,Child,Entirely possible.
48,00:07:22,2021-05-03 18:38:25,Parent,"The, (laughs), the wolf economy."
49,00:07:22,2021-05-03 18:38:25,Child,Entirely possible.
50,00:07:32,2021-05-03 18:38:35,Parent,All right.
51,00:07:33,2021-05-03 18:38:36,Child,Entirely.
52,00:07:33,2021-05-03 18:38:36,Parent,"Oh, now we're doing the other one. Okay."
53,00:07:36,2021-05-03 18:38:39,Child,(laughs). Entirely possible.
54,00:07:36,2021-05-03 18:38:39,Parent,(laughs). Entirely possible.
55,00:07:40,2021-05-03 18:38:43,Child,Entirely possible.
56,00:07:41,2021-05-03 18:38:44,Parent,"Uh. The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time, an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now, be sure to write."", she said. ""And remember that I love you."" The first little pig met a man for the load of straw. ""I know."", said the little pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea."", said the man. (laughs) You'd think the man selling the straw would want to sell the straw, but even he thought it was a bad idea. ""Mind your own business, thank you."", said the little pig. And he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all."
57,00:08:40,2021-05-03 18:39:43,Hayem,[inaudible 00:08:40]
58,00:08:41,2021-05-03 18:39:44,Parent,"Very soon, a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which, the little pig replied-"
59,00:08:41,2021-05-03 18:39:44,Child,Hum.
60,00:08:56,2021-05-03 18:39:59,Hayem,[inaudible 00:08:56]
61,00:09:03,2021-05-03 18:40:06,Child,"I want, I want something to trace my foot."
62,00:09:03,2021-05-03 18:40:06,Hayem,A laptop?
63,00:09:04,2021-05-03 18:40:07,Parent,What do you mean you want something to trace your foot?
64,00:09:04,2021-05-03 18:40:07,Child,I want something to trace my foot.
65,00:09:08,2021-05-03 18:40:11,Parent,"Oh, you wanna trace your foot? Maybe later, after."
66,00:09:10,2021-05-03 18:40:13,Child,Mamie?
67,00:09:10,2021-05-03 18:40:13,Parent,Um-
68,00:09:15,2021-05-03 18:40:18,Child,[inaudible 00:09:15].
69,00:09:15,2021-05-03 18:40:18,Hayem,[inaudible 00:09:15]
70,00:09:14,2021-05-03 18:40:17,Parent,"Um, could you guys maybe go upstairs? Or something?"
71,00:09:24,2021-05-03 18:40:27,Hayem,No.
72,00:09:24,2021-05-03 18:40:27,Parent,"To another room? Then you can wait until after maybe, cause it's overly loud. Um-"
73,00:09:36,2021-05-03 18:40:39,Child,Yeah. Feet and pinky.
74,00:09:38,2021-05-03 18:40:41,Parent,Very soon-
75,00:09:38,2021-05-03 18:40:41,Child,Up.
76,00:09:39,2021-05-03 18:40:42,Parent,"...a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead."", said the little pig. So, the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig."
77,00:10:11,2021-05-03 18:41:14,Child,A blue and purple mix. Black. Black.
78,00:10:11,2021-05-03 18:41:14,Parent,Black?
79,00:10:11,2021-05-03 18:41:14,Child,A little like black. A little like black.
80,00:10:11,2021-05-03 18:41:14,Parent,Maybe they made blurple?
81,00:10:14,2021-05-03 18:41:17,Child,Bleu.
82,00:10:31,2021-05-03 18:41:34,Parent,"Right? Blue and purple together, makes blurple. The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it."", said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that."", said the man. ""Oh poo."", said the little pig. ""What would you know?"" He bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty."", he said. No sooner than the pig had settled into his pretty house, than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry. And he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha ha ha."", said the little pig. So, the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig. The third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house."", said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow."", said the little pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. He listened to the experts. [inaudible 00:11:56]. So he bought, he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid."", said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But, no sooner than the pig had moved in, that he noticed the wolf loitered about. And the wolf, who was still hungry, said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" Well, the wolf had heard that before, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Don't do that."", said the little pig. But, the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach."", muttered the wolf. And he put on his most dazzling smile, ""Little pig, I was only teasing."", he said. ""By the way, I hear told, that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now."", said the little pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent."", said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at six."" What's the pig doing? (laughs)"
83,00:13:14,2021-05-03 18:44:17,Child,He's [inaudible 00:13:14].
84,00:13:17,2021-05-03 18:44:20,Parent,"He's a little, a little smarter. The next morning the little pig got up at five, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basketful of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at six, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait."", said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. All he could pick, ten cents."
85,00:13:41,2021-05-03 18:44:44,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative)
86,00:13:44,2021-05-03 18:44:47,Parent,"""No harm done."", he said. ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree, down in Merry meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips."", said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid."", said the wolf. ""Shall we say at five?"" What time is it? That was quick. The next morning the little pig was up at four, and went off with the apples. He took longer than he expected to reach Merry meadow. And while busy gathering up apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these."", he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree, and made it safely home. The next day the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there?"", said the little pig. ""Would three o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal."" ""Would three o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal."", said the wolf. ""Three it is."" Just to make sure he'd be there at two. At one in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair, had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the hour. Are you listening, or are you gonna continue to cover your ears?"
87,00:15:04,2021-05-03 18:46:07,Child,[inaudible 00:15:04]
88,00:15:06,2021-05-03 18:46:09,Parent,"Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn, and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, that wolf was so scared, it ran all the way home. That evening the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great brown thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"", said the little pig. ""That great brown thing was a butter churn, and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. Do you know what a butter churn is? It's something you use to make butter. ""I've been nice long enough."", he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. And the little pig saw this, and he put a big iron pot on the fireplace, and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come."", cried the wolf. ""Dinner time."" Who's for dinner?"
89,00:15:06,2021-05-03 18:46:09,Child,"Actually, the-"
90,00:16:16,2021-05-03 18:47:19,Parent,"(laughs). The wolf. ""You can say that again."", said the little pig. And he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up. You look quite dark. The end. (silence)."
91,00:16:44,2021-05-03 18:47:47,Robot,That is a great story. Do you want to read another book?
92,00:16:49,2021-05-03 18:47:52,Parent,"I think we are out of time for tonight, Jibo."
93,00:16:52,2021-05-03 18:47:55,Child,No.
94,00:16:53,2021-05-03 18:47:56,Robot,We'll call it a day. That was a great story.
95,00:17:03,2021-05-03 18:48:06,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
96,00:17:06,2021-05-03 18:48:09,Robot,"That's it for today's session. I've had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey inside..."
