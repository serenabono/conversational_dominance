Do you want to turn the pages? The three Billy goats gruff lived in a field and they spent their days munching the gr- green grass on the one side of the field there was a stream, and over the stream there was a rickety bridge. Next page? On the other side of the rickety bridge there was a hill, and there the grass grew greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the Billy goats gruff. Next page. Under the rickety bridge lived a big hairy troll in a big dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge, and that made the troll furious. He was also hungry. Whoop! Can you point to the troll?"

64,00:07:11,2021-05-27 18:29:21,Child 1,"Eat it, because they didn't help me."
65,00:07:12,2021-05-27 18:29:22,Parent,"They didn't help, yeah. So it's important for other people to help us when we need it, right?"

To which the little pig replied, ""no, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."" [inaudible 00:08:50] how did you-"
78,00:08:51,2021-05-27 18:31:01,Robot,"Eva, do you believe an hungry wolf is happy?"

The second little pig met a man with a lot of sticks. ""I've got it,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. ""Oh, poo!"" Said the little pig. ""what would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to bui- to work building a house. ""very pretty,"" he said. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry, and he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" to which the little pig replied, ""no, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."" Do you remember how he did that when you were reading the story for your class?"

96,00:10:33,2021-05-27 18:32:43,Child 1,Ha ha ha.
97,00:10:46,2021-05-27 18:32:56,Parent,"... and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig. Now the third little pig met a man with a lot of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house!"" Said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow!"" Said the little pig. So he bought, bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in, that he noticed a wolf wandering about. And the wolf, who was still hungry, said ..."
98,00:11:23,2021-05-27 18:33:33,Child 1,He ate the pigs.
99,00:11:25,2021-05-27 18:33:35,Parent,"He ate the two little pigs and now he was carrying a big balloon. [inaudible 00:11:27]. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" to which the little pig replied ..."

101,00:11:41,2021-05-27 18:33:51,Parent,"Well, the wolf had heard that before, and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that!"" Said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and  he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he what quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf. And he put on-"
102,00:12:05,2021-05-27 18:34:15,Robot,What does approach mean?

114,00:12:32,2021-05-27 18:34:42,Parent,"Yes. And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""little pig, I was only teasing,"" he said. ""by the way, I can hear that farmer Jones had the most [inaudible 00:12:43]. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm too busy now,"" said the little pig. ""what about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at 6:00."" The next morning, the little pig got up at 5:00. Oh, even earlier than you guys. Hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basket full of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6:00, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. That's a good word, displeasure."
115,00:13:19,2021-05-27 18:35:29,Child 1,I know.
116,00:13:23,2021-05-27 18:35:33,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). What else, do you know that one?"

118,00:13:26,2021-05-27 18:35:36,Parent,"Nah, yeah. That's a good one. ""No harm done,"" he said, ""by the way, there's a lovely apple tree down in the meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""i must cook my turnips,"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say at 5:00?"" The next morning the little pig was up at 4:00. oh my God. And went out for the apples. It took longer than he expected to reach merry meadow. And while [inaudible 00:13:58] busy gathering apples in the highest [inaudible 00:14:01] he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as hard as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. Do you think the, the pig is coming up with some clever ideas ..."

120,00:14:22,2021-05-27 18:36:32,Parent,"... to get away from the wolf? The next day, the wolf [inaudible 00:14:25] really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go to the fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there,"" said the little pig. ""Would 3:00 suit you?"" [inaudible 00:14:35] said the wolf. There it is. ""3:00 it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at 2:00. One ... at 1:00 in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" Said the little pig. ""That great round thing was a butter churn, and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I have been nice long enough."" He cried. How do you think he's feeling right now?"

122,00:15:32,2021-05-27 18:37:42,Parent,"So mad. ""I am going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put the big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come,"" cried the wolf. ""Dinner time!"" ""You can say that again!"" Said the little pig, and he cooked the mean old wolf and gobbled him up."
