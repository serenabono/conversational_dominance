0,00:00:00,2021-06-02 16:33:02,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:00,2021-06-02 16:33:02,Parent,Hello.
2,00:00:02,2021-06-02 16:33:04,Child,Hello.
3,00:00:04,2021-06-02 16:33:06,Robot,I am now on Story Time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording.
4,00:00:10,2021-06-02 16:33:12,Parent,Okay.
5,00:00:10,2021-06-02 16:33:12,Robot,"Let's get started. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo's Story Time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
6,00:00:25,2021-06-02 16:33:27,Parent,"Okay, select a book. What do you want? (silence). Okay. The Year At Maple Hill Farm. Summer. June is the first month of summer. The farm pond is overflowing. The pasture is green, all the animals enjoy the new green grass. Horses eat grass. Geese eat grass. Cows and sheep and goats eat grass. Chickens eat grass too, but that's not the reason the chickens are out in the pasture. They are chasing insects. The horses stir up insects with their big feet, chickens love insects. The mother duck is out on the pond. She is teaching her ducklings to swim. Someone else is out today too, the good gray cat is teaching her kittens to hunt. That bird is safe on his branch, but those squirrels had better watch out. Cats don't eat grass or insects. In June, there are enough insects to go around. The fields are hopping with insects. Grasshoppers and leafhoppers and treehoppers."
7,00:02:00,2021-06-02 16:35:02,Robot,"Jenny, maybe you can ask [Alexandre 00:02:02] a question about treehoppers."
8,00:02:06,2021-06-02 16:35:08,Parent,"Um, what kind of insect is a treehopper?"
9,00:02:12,2021-06-02 16:35:14,Child,It's...
10,00:02:12,2021-06-02 16:35:14,Parent,I actually don't know that either.
11,00:02:12,2021-06-02 16:35:14,Child,A treehopper.
12,00:02:24,2021-06-02 16:35:26,Parent,"They hop, what, what does a treehopper do, you think?"
13,00:02:29,2021-06-02 16:35:31,Child,"Oh, okay. So, the, a treehopper-"
14,00:02:33,2021-06-02 16:35:35,Parent,"Yeah, okay. Sure."
15,00:02:37,2021-06-02 16:35:39,Child,"... um, like-"
16,00:02:39,2021-06-02 16:35:41,Parent,What does he do?
17,00:02:41,2021-06-02 16:35:43,Child,"... he, he, um, he-"
18,00:02:42,2021-06-02 16:35:44,Parent,Jumps?
19,00:02:43,2021-06-02 16:35:45,Child,"... he jumps really good, and, and he finds really good."
20,00:02:47,2021-06-02 16:35:49,Parent,"And does he, what, what's the difference between a leafhopper and a treehopper?"
21,00:02:51,2021-06-02 16:35:53,Child,"The difference is that, like, uh, this one and this one, this one, this one."
22,00:03:00,2021-06-02 16:36:02,Parent,"I don't know. Does a leafhopper hop around leaves, and a treehopper hops around trees? Maybe?"
23,00:03:10,2021-06-02 16:36:12,Child,Yes.
24,00:03:12,2021-06-02 16:36:14,Parent,"Okay. There are plenty of flies around in June. Dragonflies and mayflies and blue flies and butterflies. In June, there are enough horseflies to go around and around. In summer, the fields are full of flowers. Goats and sheep like flowers. Bees like flowers. Everyone likes flowers. The flowers are buzzing with bees. Bumblebees and honeybees, and busy bees. Flowers like bees, they need them. In summer, the grass is hopping with fleas. No one likes fleas, they bite. July comes after June, it's hard to sleep on a night in July if the moon is full and shiny, and the summer stars are out. There are so many sounds to listen to. Frogs croak. Crickets chirp. An owl is hooting to another owl. The old people on the porch are chatting in low voices about old times. A cow lows now and then. You can hear the steady clink of the conveyor carrying the sweet scented hay to the loft in the barn. You can hear the quiet laughter of the men as they work. You-"
25,00:04:47,2021-06-02 16:37:49,Robot,"Time for a question. Alexandre, can you ask us a question about conveyor?"
26,00:04:52,2021-06-02 16:37:54,Parent,What is conveyor? Do you know what a conveyor is? Why don't you ask Jibo?
27,00:04:52,2021-06-02 16:37:54,Child,What is a conveyor?
28,00:05:06,2021-06-02 16:38:08,Robot,Do you know what that means?
29,00:05:08,2021-06-02 16:38:10,Child,No.
30,00:05:11,2021-06-02 16:38:13,Robot,Make a guess.
31,00:05:13,2021-06-02 16:38:15,Parent,I'll read it again. You can hear the steady clink of the conveyor carrying the sweet scented hay to the loft in the barn. Look at the picture. The hay is going from the loft to the barn.
32,00:05:27,2021-06-02 16:38:29,Child,The hay is like a little k- like a pillow.
33,00:05:33,2021-06-02 16:38:35,Parent,"No, conveyor is this ramp, you see? It's helping it go from this loft into the barn because it's too heavy for them, too big and heavy for them to carry."
34,00:05:33,2021-06-02 16:38:35,Child,Yeah.
35,00:05:45,2021-06-02 16:38:47,Parent,"So, it's a conveyor belt. You know how at the airport, the suitcases go through a conveyor to get onto the airplane?"
36,00:05:52,2021-06-02 16:38:54,Child,Yes.
37,00:05:53,2021-06-02 16:38:55,Parent,"So, it's called a conveyor."
38,00:05:55,2021-06-02 16:38:57,Child,"Because, it's, like, and som- or sometimes you put it, there's, like, a long thing-"
39,00:06:05,2021-06-02 16:39:07,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
40,00:06:06,2021-06-02 16:39:08,Child,... that you put it into the-
41,00:06:06,2021-06-02 16:39:08,Parent,Into the airplane?
42,00:06:09,2021-06-02 16:39:11,Child,... into the airplane.
43,00:06:11,2021-06-02 16:39:13,Parent,"Okay. Good. You can hear a mother goose hissing softly, warning strangers from her nest in the shed. Sometimes, if everything is silent for a moment, you can hear the horses eating grass. August is the last summer month. The sky is blue, the sun shines. The sun shines and shines. Late summer is a drowsy time of year. The days are hot and lazy. The cows doze away the noon day. The sheep graze and graze all day. The lambs are growing by the minute. The flowers are growing too. Flowers need hours of attention in August heat. The vegetables need attention too. Someone is stealing the lettuce, what good is a watchdog? Almost asleep in the puddle of dust, a dog will still wag his tail as you walk by. The geese are quieter in August. All the noise nesting is over for a while. Sit up, please. [inaudible 00:07:24]. The pig has tipped over her pail, now she has a cold mud puddle to sleep in. You know it is hot when that old cat comes out for a breath of air. The end."
44,00:07:46,2021-06-02 16:40:48,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up here.
45,00:07:55,2021-06-02 16:40:57,Parent,You have a question?
46,00:07:55,2021-06-02 16:40:57,Child,No.
47,00:07:57,2021-06-02 16:40:59,Robot,Any story questions?
48,00:08:01,2021-06-02 16:41:03,Child,No.
49,00:08:04,2021-06-02 16:41:06,Robot,What did you learn?
50,00:08:05,2021-06-02 16:41:07,Parent,What did you learn? You have to answer Jibo.
51,00:08:12,2021-06-02 16:41:14,Child,Little.
52,00:08:19,2021-06-02 16:41:21,Parent,The what?
53,00:08:22,2021-06-02 16:41:24,Child,To make it go up.
54,00:08:24,2021-06-02 16:41:26,Parent,You can talk to Jibo.
55,00:08:29,2021-06-02 16:41:31,Child,[inaudible 00:08:29].
56,00:08:31,2021-06-02 16:41:33,Parent,What are you talking about? Why do you have to whisper? It's a tree. This is the-
57,00:08:34,2021-06-02 16:41:36,Robot,"Please, please."
58,00:08:39,2021-06-02 16:41:41,Parent,"... you have to push the corner to flip the page. You should've stopped mommy when I was reading. The conveyor? You wanna talk about the conveyor again? Ask Jibo, what's the question?"
59,00:09:07,2021-06-02 16:42:09,Child,Why do we need-
60,00:09:07,2021-06-02 16:42:09,Parent,Why do we need a conveyor?
61,00:09:08,2021-06-02 16:42:10,Robot,Do you know what it means now?
62,00:09:09,2021-06-02 16:42:11,Child,... why do we need a conveyor?
63,00:09:16,2021-06-02 16:42:18,Parent,"Well, because the hay is really heavy. Right?"
64,00:09:18,2021-06-02 16:42:20,Robot,What do you think?
65,00:09:18,2021-06-02 16:42:20,Parent,What do you think?
66,00:09:24,2021-06-02 16:42:26,Child,"Because, the, the, the hay is heavy."
67,00:09:31,2021-06-02 16:42:33,Parent,"Yeah, they can't carry it up. And, there's so many of them, so they can just put it on, and then it can keep on going up and up and up. So, it's very efficient. Right? Okay."
68,00:09:47,2021-06-02 16:42:49,Robot,We need it to carry something.
69,00:09:48,2021-06-02 16:42:50,Child,"But, why does he not put another full bag that goes inside the room?"
70,00:09:56,2021-06-02 16:42:58,Parent,"You know, people carrying it by that time, they need so many. Right?"
71,00:10:02,2021-06-02 16:43:04,Child,"But, what if it falls down?"
72,00:10:08,2021-06-02 16:43:10,Parent,It's not gonna fall down. Good? You wanna do another book? You want the fall?
73,00:10:13,2021-06-02 16:43:15,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
74,00:10:15,2021-06-02 16:43:17,Parent,Swipe.
75,00:10:16,2021-06-02 16:43:18,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
76,00:10:21,2021-06-02 16:43:23,Parent,"[inaudible 00:10:21] purchase a book, I think. Those are the long books, unless you go for the short books."
77,00:10:21,2021-06-02 16:43:23,Child,Short books.
78,00:10:26,2021-06-02 16:43:28,Parent,"[inaudible 00:10:26]. Short. Okay, what kind you choosing now?"
79,00:10:26,2021-06-02 16:43:28,Child,"Look, I want them."
80,00:10:47,2021-06-02 16:43:49,Parent,Okay. On the farm. [crosstalk 00:10:47].
81,00:10:47,2021-06-02 16:43:49,Child,"Oh, we already did that."
82,00:10:47,2021-06-02 16:43:49,Parent,X out.
83,00:10:47,2021-06-02 16:43:49,Child,We already did it.
84,00:10:47,2021-06-02 16:43:49,Parent,"[inaudible 00:10:47]. Do you wanna do Chicka, Boom, Chicka, Boom, Boom?"
85,00:11:05,2021-06-02 16:44:07,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
86,00:11:11,2021-06-02 16:44:13,Parent,"A told B and B told C, I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree. ""Wee,"" said D to E, F, G, ""I'll beat you the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka, chicka, boom, boom, will there be enough room? Here comes H up the coconut tree. And I and J, and tag along K, all on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka, chicka, boom, boom, will there be enough room? Look who's coming. L, M, N, O, P and Q, R, S and T, U, V. Still more. W and X, Y, Z. The whole alphabet up the, oh, no. Chicka, chicka, boom, boom. Skit, Skat, Skoodledoot, flip flop, flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree. Mamas and papas, and uncles and aunts, hug their little dears, then dust their pants."
87,00:12:36,2021-06-02 16:45:38,Robot,Maybe you can ask us a recall question about little dears.
88,00:12:43,2021-06-02 16:45:45,Parent,Hug their little dears. What does that mean?
89,00:12:47,2021-06-02 16:45:49,Child,"That means that they're hugging their little, their, their little ah- the little, um-"
90,00:12:55,2021-06-02 16:45:57,Parent,Letter?
91,00:12:55,2021-06-02 16:45:57,Child,... their little letter.
92,00:13:00,2021-06-02 16:46:02,Parent,"Okay. Good. ""Help us up,"" cried A, B, C. Next from the pile up, skinned knee D, and stubbed toe E, and patched up F, then comes G all out of breath. H is tangled up with I. J and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie. M is looped. N is stooped. O is twisted ally boop. Skit, skat, skoodledoot. Flip, flop, flee. Look who's coming, it's black eyed P, Q, R, S and loose toothed T. Then U, V, W wiggle, jiggle free. Last to come, X, Y, Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree. But, chicka, chicka, boom, boom, look, there's a full moon. A is out of bed and this is what he said. ""Dare, double dare, you can't catch me. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka, chicka, boom, boom. The end."
93,00:14:30,2021-06-02 16:47:32,Robot,"I am curious, what would be an interesting recall question to ask here? Could you help me come up with one?"
94,00:14:37,2021-06-02 16:47:39,Parent,"Go for it, Alex."
95,00:14:43,2021-06-02 16:47:45,Child,Hmm.
96,00:14:43,2021-06-02 16:47:45,Parent,Question.
97,00:14:47,2021-06-02 16:47:49,Child,"Why did the L, why did the A say that, ""I'm gonna beat you soon,"" because there was no one on the, on the tree."
98,00:15:03,2021-06-02 16:48:05,Robot,Well. What is it? Read a question. Bravo. Great question.
99,00:15:20,2021-06-02 16:48:22,Parent,"But, he's saying, ""I'll beat you to the top... Oh, because everyone, no one's there?"
100,00:15:26,2021-06-02 16:48:28,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
101,00:15:27,2021-06-02 16:48:29,Parent,Yeah. I don't know. Good. You wanna read one more?
102,00:15:34,2021-06-02 16:48:36,Child,No.
103,00:15:36,2021-06-02 16:48:38,Parent,It's up to Jibo. We have to read if Jibo wants us to read. Right? What do you want? Another short story then.
104,00:15:36,2021-06-02 16:48:38,Child,Long story.
105,00:15:45,2021-06-02 16:48:47,Parent,"No, short story. The longs are g- it's fine, if you want a long story, have a long story. Farm animals. Farm animals, the animals that live on the farm help us in many ways. Some give us eggs, some give us wool for clothes, some give us meat, some give us milk to drink. Do you know who does what? Who gives us eggs, Alex?"
106,00:16:21,2021-06-02 16:49:23,Child,The chicken.
107,00:16:22,2021-06-02 16:49:24,Parent,"Good. I think they're gonna tell us. Lamb, ""My mom is a ewe, my dad is a ram. And me? Well, I'm a fluffy lamb. Did you know, in summer, farmers sheer their sheep? The sheep keep cool and the farmers keep the wool."" Sheepdog, ""I help the farmer to herd his sheep, then I lie in my basket and fall fast asleep. And wag my tail when I'm happy and glad, I yelp and howl when I'm feeling sad. Did you know farmers use whistles to talk to their dogs and tell them what to do?"" Pig, ""I grunt and I snort, and I dig about. I look for roots with my pink piggy snout. When it's hot, I roll in the mud or a pool, it's the only way I can keep my cool. Did you know pig meat is called pork? Ham, bacon and sausage, are all kinds of pork."" Chicken, ""I strut around, I scratch the ground, I'm fine, I'm proud. I'm very loud. Cocka-doodle-doo. I scratch for food with my chicken feet, and I lay eggs for you to eat. Did you know chickens can not fly far? They use their wings to fly up to a perch at night."" Cow, ""Did you know milk is used to make butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream? I am a cow, hear me moo. I make milk, it's good for you."""
108,00:18:15,2021-06-02 16:51:17,Robot,"Perhaps it's a good time for us to talk about cow. Jenny, do you want to start a chat?"
109,00:18:22,2021-06-02 16:51:24,Parent,"Did you know that cows make butter, cheese, yogurt and ice cream, Alex?"
110,00:18:27,2021-06-02 16:51:29,Child,"Hmm. I like to eat, ice cream and cheese and yogurt."
111,00:18:38,2021-06-02 16:51:40,Parent,"Yeah. You didn't know about the butter, I guess?"
112,00:18:40,2021-06-02 16:51:42,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
113,00:18:42,2021-06-02 16:51:44,Parent,"Well, we learned something new."
114,00:18:46,2021-06-02 16:51:48,Child,Butter.
115,00:18:46,2021-06-02 16:51:48,Parent,"Butter. Horse, ""Did you know horses were once used to pull plows and carts on the farm? I stand up all day, I eat grass and hay, but what I like best is to gallop and play."" Duck, ""See me waddle, hear me quack. I duck under water for a wheaty snack. I'm always looking for food to eat, I splash all day with my wings and feet. Did you know ducks have waterproof feathers to keep them dry?"" Goat, ""I have a beard and horns, I'm a Billy goat. When it's cold, I keep warm in my wooly, wooly coat. In the fields, I skip around, see how high I leap and bound? Did you know goats milk can be used to make tasty cheeses?"" Cat, ""During the day I wash my paws, but when nighttime comes, I sharpen my claws. I sneak around the barn or house, I'm ready to pounce on an unlucky mouse. Did you know cats have special eyes so they can see at night?"""
116,00:18:46,2021-06-02 16:51:48,Child,I already knew that.
117,00:20:03,2021-06-02 16:53:05,Parent,"Goose, ""I hang out by the pond where I like to be boss. Mess with me and I'll become cross. Then,"" what does cross mean?"
118,00:20:11,2021-06-02 16:53:13,Child,That means [inaudible 00:20:12].
119,00:20:14,2021-06-02 16:53:16,Parent,"(laughs). ""Then, I'll honk and hiss, just like this. Did you know geese eat grass? They pull it up with their strong beaks."" The end."
120,00:20:31,2021-06-02 16:53:33,Child,Done.
121,00:20:31,2021-06-02 16:53:33,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch ba-
