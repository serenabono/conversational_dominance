""very well then."" Said the little red hen, ""I will plant them myself."" She dug holes in the ground and planted the seeds in them. A very busy hen was she. Every day the little red hen searched for food to feed her young ones. She also found time to care for the seedling. She and her chicks watched as the wheat grass grew strong and ripe. ""It is now time for harvesting."" Said the little red hen. ""Who will help me to cut-"
98,00:13:44,2021-05-23 21:13:36,Robot,"Perhaps it's a good time for us to talk about seedlings. Brennan, do you want to start a chat?"

""Surely you will."" Said the little red hen to the rat ""You can use your tail to chop so easily."" ""Not I."" Said the rat. ""Very well then, I will do it myself."" Said the little red hen. After snipping the stalks with her beak, she separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen was she. ""Who will help me take the grain to the mill."" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Not I."" Said the dog. ""Not I."" Said the rat. ""Surely you will."" Said the little red hen to the goat, ""You are strong and steady and it's a lovely day to take out your cart."" ""Not I."" Said the goat. ""Very well."" Said the little red hen, ""I will do it myself."" So she fetched her shawl then she trudged off to the mill.

""Surely you will."" Said the little red hen to the pig, ""It won't take much effort at all and you are always delighted with my cooking."" ""Not I."" Said the pig. ""Very well."" Said the little red hen, ""I will do it myself."" She mixed the flour with yeast, salt and water. Then kneed the dough, slipped it into a loaf, and put it in to the oven. At last the bread was done. The little red hen took the hot loaf out of the oven. A tasty aroma circled the barnyard. ""I know who will eat the golden bread."" Said the little red hen. ""I surely will.""
