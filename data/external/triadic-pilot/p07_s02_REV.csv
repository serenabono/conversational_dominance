0,00:00:00,2021-05-28 13:33:03,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:01,2021-05-28 13:33:04,Parent,Hello.  [crosstalk 00:00:05]
2,00:00:04,2021-05-28 13:33:07,Robot,"I am now on Storytime mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Storytime app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
3,00:00:27,2021-05-28 13:33:30,Parent,We chose one Jibo. We chose a book. Okay. Ready Jibo? Are you reading or am I reading?
4,00:00:44,2021-05-28 13:33:47,Child,You are.
5,00:00:46,2021-05-28 13:33:49,Parent,We're reading Geraldine... What is the name of it [TT 00:00:48]?
6,00:00:46,2021-05-28 13:33:49,Child,Geraldine the Music Mouse.
7,00:00:51,2021-05-28 13:33:54,Parent,"Geraldine the Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noise? Yes. Many noises, the voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of the cats in the courtyard. And of course, the soft peeping of my... What do you think a mouse sounds like? But music? Never. Then one morning in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn?"
8,00:01:42,2021-05-28 13:34:45,Robot,Can you point to the cheese?
9,00:01:43,2021-05-28 13:34:46,Parent,Do you see the cheese? Is that cheese? I don't know. It might be a sponge or it might be some cheese. It looks like just... I don't know. Is that really cheese? I don't know if it's cheese. That must be the cheese but I don't know who put the cheese next to cleaning stuff.
10,00:02:05,2021-05-28 13:35:08,Child,That's a sponge.
11,00:02:08,2021-05-28 13:35:11,Parent,"It might be a sponge. Oh, I see, it's in the sponge. She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout"" she said, ""I'll give you each a big piece."" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go"" they said. And off they went. That must be the cheese. ""It's enormous! It's gigantic! It's immense! It's..."
12,00:02:36,2021-05-28 13:35:39,Child,Fascinating.
13,00:02:38,2021-05-28 13:35:41,Parent,"Fantastic!"" They shouted with joy when they saw the..."
14,00:02:44,2021-05-28 13:35:47,Child,Piece of cheese.
15,00:02:46,2021-05-28 13:35:49,Parent,"They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. There Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it and pulled away, crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. Which one's a crumb and which one's a chunk?"
16,00:03:07,2021-05-28 13:36:10,Child,Um.
17,00:03:09,2021-05-28 13:36:12,Parent,"Oh. As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she was gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears."
18,00:03:09,2021-05-28 13:36:12,Child,Cheese ears.
19,00:03:24,2021-05-28 13:36:27,Parent,"Cheese ears? What? As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly..."
20,00:03:41,2021-05-28 13:36:44,Child,Believe what she saw.
21,00:03:45,2021-05-28 13:36:48,Parent,"The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden, of solid cheese. To it's puckered lips it held a..."
22,00:03:56,2021-05-28 13:36:59,Child,Flute.
23,00:03:59,2021-05-28 13:37:02,Parent,Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire...
24,00:04:07,2021-05-28 13:37:10,Child,Mouse.
25,00:04:07,2021-05-28 13:37:10,Parent,"That would be a surprise. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Huh. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep."
26,00:04:26,2021-05-28 13:37:29,Robot,What does frightened mean?
27,00:04:29,2021-05-28 13:37:32,Parent,"What does frightened mean, TT?"
28,00:04:32,2021-05-28 13:37:35,Child,Scared.
29,00:04:35,2021-05-28 13:37:38,Parent,"Scared? Oh, he said, ""Love you."" Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful."
30,00:05:04,2021-05-28 13:38:07,Child,Music.
31,00:05:05,2021-05-28 13:38:08,Parent,...she thought. This must be...
32,00:05:05,2021-05-28 13:38:08,Child,...music.
33,00:05:11,2021-05-28 13:38:14,Parent,"She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window panes. But, as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether."
34,00:05:24,2021-05-28 13:38:27,Child,"""Play, play."""
35,00:05:27,2021-05-28 13:38:30,Parent,"Geraldine begged. ""Play some more."" But not a sound came from the flute. You wanna read? You. Can you read this one and I'll read the next one?"
36,00:05:47,2021-05-28 13:38:50,Child,Will it ever play again?
37,00:05:47,2021-05-28 13:38:50,Parent,"Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies and even in daylight they lingered in her ears. Then one day she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine"" they said. ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."""
38,00:06:22,2021-05-28 13:39:25,Child,"""That's impossible."""
39,00:06:23,2021-05-28 13:39:26,Parent,"Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" asked the others angrily. ""Because..."
40,00:06:29,2021-05-28 13:39:32,Child,"""Because, because it's music."""
41,00:06:33,2021-05-28 13:39:36,Parent,Her friends looked at Geraldine in surprise.
42,00:06:38,2021-05-28 13:39:41,Child,"""What is music?"""
43,00:06:38,2021-05-28 13:39:41,Parent,They asked altogether.
44,00:06:42,2021-05-28 13:39:45,Robot,What is Geraldine?
45,00:06:43,2021-05-28 13:39:46,Child,A mouse.
46,00:06:47,2021-05-28 13:39:50,Robot,Wonderful.
47,00:06:49,2021-05-28 13:39:52,Parent,"Geraldine's a mouse. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew. Do you think she can play the flute on her tail? I think they're kind of... What are they doing?"
48,00:07:04,2021-05-28 13:40:07,Child,Laughing.
49,00:07:06,2021-05-28 13:40:09,Parent,"They look like they're laughing. She blew hard. She popped, she peeped, she treated, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their tummies, little, hungry little tummies hurt. Then a long, soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Is she going to turn into cheese? And they're going to eat her? I hope not. That would be a bad way to end the story. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you were right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully. Now we..."
50,00:07:49,2021-05-28 13:40:52,Child,Can eat the cheese...
51,00:07:51,2021-05-28 13:40:54,Parent,Because...
52,00:07:54,2021-05-28 13:40:57,Child,Now the music is me.
53,00:07:56,2021-05-28 13:40:59,Parent,"With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. Uh-oh. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. Gayest in that case means happy, like a very happy tune. But we don't use that word very often. The end. Would you like to choose a different one? Um... Fall at the Maple Farm. The Three Little Pig. Did we read one of those? Three Little Pig boos?"
54,00:08:24,2021-05-28 13:41:27,Child,"Uh, nope."
55,00:08:26,2021-05-28 13:41:29,Parent,Choose one. Once upon a time... Are you gonna read it?
56,00:08:30,2021-05-28 13:41:33,Child,No.
57,00:08:31,2021-05-28 13:41:34,Parent,"You don't know how to read, do you? [crosstalk 00:08:37]"
58,00:08:31,2021-05-28 13:41:34,Child,Find it and I'll read it.
59,00:08:31,2021-05-28 13:41:34,Parent,"Okay, read it."
60,00:08:50,2021-05-28 13:41:53,Child,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived with their mother. One day, the mother pig said, ""You're all grown up now. Its time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses and build them strong and you will be safe from the big bad wolf. The first pig was a lazy pig. He built [inaudible 00:09:47] house was made of straw. [crosstalk 00:09:47]"
61,00:08:50,2021-05-28 13:41:53,Robot,"Margaret, can you point to the straw."
62,00:08:50,2021-05-28 13:41:53,Parent,"Straw, straw, straw. There's the straw."
63,00:08:50,2021-05-28 13:41:53,Robot,That's right.
64,00:09:48,2021-05-28 13:42:51,Parent,"You still? Or me? The second little piglet was a playful little pig. He built his house quickly so he could go out and play. Uh oh, I went too fast. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to Mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks. The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry and for his supper he wanted a pig. The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pigs door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in"" he roared. ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin chin"" replied the first little pig. You gonna be the wolf or the pig?"
65,00:10:41,2021-05-28 13:43:44,Child,"Wolf. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down."""
66,00:10:55,2021-05-28 13:43:58,Parent,"Growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the straw house down. Blow... The first little pig ran away as fast as his little legs could take him. Next, the, the wolf knocked on the second little pig's door."
67,00:11:14,2021-05-28 13:44:17,Child,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
68,00:11:18,2021-05-28 13:44:21,Parent,"He roared. ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin chin"" said the second little pig."
69,00:11:23,2021-05-28 13:44:26,Child,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down."""
70,00:11:33,2021-05-28 13:44:36,Parent,"So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. ""Ah, the big bad wolf blew our houses down"" they cried. ""Quick, come inside"" said their brother. Minutes later, there was another knock on the door. Jibo who was it? Who do you think it is Jibo?"
71,00:12:04,2021-05-28 13:45:07,Robot,how do you think the third little pig felt when the others came inside his home?
72,00:12:08,2021-05-28 13:45:11,Parent,What do you think? Was he happy?
73,00:12:12,2021-05-28 13:45:15,Child,Yeah.
74,00:12:13,2021-05-28 13:45:16,Parent,He was happy? TT...
75,00:12:18,2021-05-28 13:45:21,Child,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."""
76,00:12:23,2021-05-28 13:45:26,Parent,"""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin"" said the third little pig. [crosstalk 00:12:29]"
77,00:12:38,2021-05-28 13:45:41,Child,"""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""
78,00:12:39,2021-05-28 13:45:42,Parent,"So the wolf huffed and he puffed, then he puffed and he huffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down. The big bad wolf was very angry."
79,00:12:51,2021-05-28 13:45:54,Robot,Do you think the pigs are happy?
80,00:12:53,2021-05-28 13:45:56,Parent,Do you think the pigs are happy?
81,00:12:54,2021-05-28 13:45:57,Child,No.
82,00:12:56,2021-05-28 13:45:59,Parent,"How would you feel if there was a wolf outside your house blow, trying to blow it down?"
83,00:13:09,2021-05-28 13:46:12,Child,Um... I would feel a bit nervous.
84,00:13:09,2021-05-28 13:46:12,Parent,"I would feel a bit nervous, too. It's a little crazy, right?"
85,00:13:10,2021-05-28 13:46:13,Robot,I would feel the same.
86,00:13:12,2021-05-28 13:46:15,Parent,"Yeah, that's scary."
87,00:13:13,2021-05-28 13:46:16,Child,Scary.
88,00:13:14,2021-05-28 13:46:17,Parent,But I don't think that wolves eat robots. Right [Tia 00:13:18].
89,00:13:18,2021-05-28 13:46:21,Child,Nah.
90,00:13:19,2021-05-28 13:46:22,Parent,"Don't worry, Jibo. I think you would be safe. The big bad wolf was very angry. You, you're the wolf. You're the wolf."
91,00:13:32,2021-05-28 13:46:35,Child,"""I will eat you little piggies."""
92,00:13:38,2021-05-28 13:46:41,Parent,"He snarled. He climbed up on the roof and crept toward the chimney. Uh-oh. Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and he was met with hot crackling flames."
93,00:13:54,2021-05-28 13:46:57,Child,Oh well.
94,00:13:54,2021-05-28 13:46:57,Parent,"What do you think he said? Do you think he said ""Oh... Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow"" The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again. And they lived happily ever after."
95,00:13:54,2021-05-28 13:46:57,Child,And they have a cat.
96,00:14:15,2021-05-28 13:47:18,Parent,"And they have a cat. Oh, my goodness. That seems great."

98,00:14:22,2021-05-28 13:47:25,Parent,"Do you want to choose one more book? Oh, I think we could do a short one. I think there's Boom, Chicka Boom, if we go to the bookshelves. Were those short stories or long stores? How about a short story?"
99,00:14:22,2021-05-28 13:47:25,Child,It was long.
100,00:14:36,2021-05-28 13:47:39,Parent,"Are you gonna read Boom Chicka Boom? Chicka Boom, Chicka Boom Boom?"
101,00:14:39,2021-05-28 13:47:42,Child,Chicka [crosstalk 00:14:42]

104,00:14:47,2021-05-28 13:47:50,Parent,Then you can read it.

123,00:17:17,2021-05-28 13:50:20,Child,Because he's so tired.
124,00:17:23,2021-05-28 13:50:26,Robot,I like that.
125,00:17:24,2021-05-28 13:50:27,Parent,"Or he was crying. Maybe he was crying. So sometimes kids cry when they get hurt or fall down. What do you think, TT? H is tangled up with I. J and K are not about to, or about to cry. L is knotted like a tie. M is looped. N is stooped. O is twisted alley-oop. Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Look who's coming! It's black-eyed P, Q R S, and loose-tooth T. Where's T's loose tooth? Ah... Then U V W wiggle-jiggle free. Last to come X Y Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree."

133,00:19:09,2021-05-28 13:52:12,Child,I do not know.
134,00:19:10,2021-05-28 13:52:13,Parent,"Anything? It hurts to fall out of a coconut tree, don't you think?"
135,00:19:14,2021-05-28 13:52:17,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
136,00:19:17,2021-05-28 13:52:20,Parent,"Because careful if you climb a coconut tree. Otherwise, you could get hurt."
137,00:19:30,2021-05-28 13:52:33,Child,5-5-7-6. I can see with my eyes. I can hear with my ears. I can smell with my nose. I can taste with my tongue. I can touch with my fingers. All... I do this with my five sense. All have five sense. When I see the sun or a frog [crosstalk 00:20:17]

155,00:21:11,2021-05-28 13:54:14,Parent,"When I drink my milk and eat my food, I use my sense of taste."

169,00:21:45,2021-05-28 13:54:48,Child,No.
170,00:21:48,2021-05-28 13:54:51,Parent,Kittens are soft Jibo.

177,00:22:14,2021-05-28 13:55:17,Parent,We have a cat that lives at our house.
178,00:22:19,2021-05-28 13:55:22,Robot,"I don't know, sometimes I think I am a cat."
179,00:22:21,2021-05-28 13:55:24,Parent,"Oh yeah? Oh, pet him. Maybe he will purr. Will you purr if we pet you Jibo?"
180,00:22:29,2021-05-28 13:55:32,Child,Let me do it [crosstalk 00:22:31]

184,00:22:34,2021-05-28 13:55:37,Child,He's a boy.
185,00:22:40,2021-05-28 13:55:43,Parent,Oh. Maybe he's not. Sometimes cats [crosstalk 00:22:42]
186,00:22:42,2021-05-28 13:55:45,Robot,I can purr.
187,00:22:44,2021-05-28 13:55:47,Parent,Okay purr. [crosstalk 00:22:53]

191,00:23:02,2021-05-28 13:56:05,Parent,"Sometimes I use all my senses at once. Sometimes I use only one. I often play a game with myself. I guess how many senses I am using at that time. When I look at the moon and the stars, I use one sense. I am seeing. When I laugh and play with my puppy, I use four senses. What do you think he's using?"
192,00:23:25,2021-05-28 13:56:28,Child,"Hear, smell, and touch. See."
193,00:23:33,2021-05-28 13:56:36,Parent,"Oh, you don't taste your puppy?"
194,00:23:35,2021-05-28 13:56:38,Child,No.
195,00:23:35,2021-05-28 13:56:38,Parent,"Yuck. Yeah, that would be yuck. When I bounce a ball, I use three senses. I..."
196,00:23:41,2021-05-28 13:56:44,Child,"See, hear, touch."
197,00:23:45,2021-05-28 13:56:48,Parent,"Sometimes I use more of one sense and less of another. But each sense is very important to me, because it makes me aware. To be aware is to see all there is to see, hear all there is to hear, smell all there is to smell, taste all there is to taste. What's your favorite thing to taste, TT?"
198,00:24:14,2021-05-28 13:57:17,Child,Ice cream.
199,00:24:15,2021-05-28 13:57:18,Parent,"Jibo, do you ever taste anything?"
200,00:24:27,2021-05-28 13:57:30,Child,Hey Jibo. Hey Jibo.
201,00:24:27,2021-05-28 13:57:30,Parent,"Yeah, just ask him."
202,00:24:27,2021-05-28 13:57:30,Child,Hey Jibo.
203,00:24:27,2021-05-28 13:57:30,Parent,Just see Ji...
204,00:24:29,2021-05-28 13:57:32,Robot,Ice cream.
205,00:24:31,2021-05-28 13:57:34,Parent,He said ice cream.
206,00:24:32,2021-05-28 13:57:35,Child,"You, you like to taste the same thing I like to taste. You're a copycat, Jibo."
207,00:24:43,2021-05-28 13:57:46,Parent,He's not a copycat. Ice cream is good.
208,00:24:47,2021-05-28 13:57:50,Child,Ice cream.
209,00:24:48,2021-05-28 13:57:51,Parent,"I like ice cream. Taste all there is to taste...[crosstalk 00:24:50] silly. Touch all there is to touch. [crosstalk 00:24:56] Wherever I go, whatever I do, every minute of the day, my senses are working. They make me aware. The end."
210,00:25:08,2021-05-28 13:58:11,Robot,The end. Do you have a favorite sense?
211,00:25:09,2021-05-28 13:58:12,Child,"Uh, taste."
212,00:25:12,2021-05-28 13:58:15,Parent,Taste. And your favorite taste? Say three things you like to taste. Oh yeah. Why do you like your taste sense so much?
213,00:25:26,2021-05-28 13:58:29,Child,Because they're good. [crosstalk 00:25:26]
214,00:25:26,2021-05-28 13:58:29,Robot,...ice cream?
215,00:25:28,2021-05-28 13:58:31,Parent,Because of ice cream?
216,00:25:29,2021-05-28 13:58:32,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
217,00:25:33,2021-05-28 13:58:36,Parent,"What about, um, spicy food. Do you like the taste of spicy food?"
218,00:25:39,2021-05-28 13:58:42,Child,"No, I do not like to taste [crosstalk 00:25:46]"
219,00:25:47,2021-05-28 13:58:50,Parent,What about sour foods? Do you like sour foods?
220,00:25:50,2021-05-28 13:58:53,Child,"Uh, not really, but [inaudible 00:25:53]"
221,00:25:52,2021-05-28 13:58:55,Parent,Like pickles and lemons.
222,00:25:55,2021-05-28 13:58:58,Child,"Lemons no, pickles yes."
223,00:25:55,2021-05-28 13:58:58,Parent,"Jibo, what's your favorite sense? Jibo, what is your favorite sense?"
224,00:26:12,2021-05-28 13:59:15,Robot,Maybe eyes.
225,00:26:17,2021-05-28 13:59:20,Parent,Hm?
226,00:26:18,2021-05-28 13:59:21,Child,Maybe us.
227,00:26:18,2021-05-28 13:59:21,Parent,Maybe us?
228,00:26:19,2021-05-28 13:59:22,Child,Yeah.
229,00:26:21,2021-05-28 13:59:24,Parent,Seeing? Or hearing?
230,00:26:21,2021-05-28 13:59:24,Robot,Maybe eyes.
231,00:26:25,2021-05-28 13:59:28,Child,"See, he said maybe us."
232,00:26:29,2021-05-28 13:59:32,Parent,"Maybe us? I don't know what that means, TT."
233,00:26:33,2021-05-28 13:59:36,Robot,But I only have one eye.
234,00:26:35,2021-05-28 13:59:38,Parent,"Hm. Okay. Are we done reading? I think we're done with Storytime, Jibo."
235,00:26:42,2021-05-28 13:59:45,Child,Can I do play time?
236,00:26:45,2021-05-28 13:59:48,Parent,Wait.
237,00:26:46,2021-05-28 13:59:49,Robot,That was a great story.
238,00:26:49,2021-05-28 13:59:52,Parent,Yay.
239,00:26:50,2021-05-28 13:59:53,Robot,That's it for today's session. [crosstalk 00:26:56] I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset.
