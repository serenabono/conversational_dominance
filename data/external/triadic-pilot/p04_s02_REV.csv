2,00:00:08,2021-05-08 12:04:30,Parent,Hello. [inaudible 00:00:08].
3,00:00:08,2021-05-08 12:04:30,Robot,"I am now on Story Time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Story Time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:33,2021-05-08 12:04:55,Parent,Okay. Well do a short-
5,00:00:33,2021-05-08 12:04:55,Robot,Short.

9,00:00:35,2021-05-08 12:04:57,Child,Yeah.
10,00:00:35,2021-05-08 12:04:57,Robot,I do better over here.
11,00:00:35,2021-05-08 12:04:57,Parent,Look at all these books. Which one?
12,00:00:35,2021-05-08 12:04:57,Child,"Mm, that."
13,00:00:49,2021-05-08 12:05:11,Parent,"Okay. Jibo's looking over there. Hey, Jibo. He's in story mode, so he's not looking. Oh, you have to be quiet to activate it."
14,00:00:49,2021-05-08 12:05:11,Robot,Yeah.
15,00:01:00,2021-05-08 12:05:22,Parent,"Okay. On the Farm. The rooster crows and he struts. He's got feathers. He's got [crosstalk 00:01:13]... Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows. The cow makes milk, standing, grazing. Abracadabra, abracadabra (laughs) [inaudible 00:01:30]. She's utterly [inaudible 00:01:34]. The pony whinnies in the winds, kicks his stall, he's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall. The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shade of the farmhouse yard-"
16,00:01:48,2021-05-08 12:06:10,Child,He's bigger than those kids.
17,00:01:50,2021-05-08 12:06:12,Parent,"That's called perspective. So the dog is just really close to the camera, right?"
18,00:01:50,2021-05-08 12:06:12,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
19,00:01:56,2021-05-08 12:06:18,Parent,"The drawing is just showing that the dog is a lot closer to you and that they're further back. So the perspective makes it look bigger. But it's not bigger. It just means that the dog is closer to the reader than the people in the house. So it says, you might think he's keeping cool. Beware, he's keeping guard. The sheep began his wooly life as a gentle... As gentle as a lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram. Bam."
20,00:02:31,2021-05-08 12:06:53,Child,(laughs).
21,00:02:31,2021-05-08 12:06:53,Parent,(laughs).
22,00:02:31,2021-05-08 12:06:53,Child,They're not sheep.
23,00:02:31,2021-05-08 12:06:53,Robot,"Perhaps it's a good time for us to talk about sheep. Adam, do you want to start a chat?"
24,00:02:37,2021-05-08 12:06:59,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
25,00:02:38,2021-05-08 12:07:00,Parent,Should you say please [inaudible 00:02:40]?
26,00:02:38,2021-05-08 12:07:00,Child,Yes.
27,00:02:46,2021-05-08 12:07:08,Parent,He said yes.
28,00:02:50,2021-05-08 12:07:12,Robot,Nice. Do you like sheep?
29,00:02:57,2021-05-08 12:07:19,Child,"Yes. I like, I like to pet them."
30,00:03:00,2021-05-08 12:07:22,Parent,(laughs).

33,00:03:09,2021-05-08 12:07:31,Robot,Right.
34,00:03:23,2021-05-08 12:07:45,Parent,"(laughs) The barn cat, mice had better think twice."
35,00:03:28,2021-05-08 12:07:50,Child,I'm gonna change her.
36,00:03:32,2021-05-08 12:07:54,Parent,What? [inaudible 00:03:32]-
37,00:03:35,2021-05-08 12:07:57,Child,I can't change it.
38,00:03:36,2021-05-08 12:07:58,Parent,Why?
39,00:03:38,2021-05-08 12:08:00,Child,[inaudible 00:03:38].
40,00:03:40,2021-05-08 12:08:02,Parent,[inaudible 00:03:40].
41,00:03:40,2021-05-08 12:08:02,Child,Change.
42,00:03:42,2021-05-08 12:08:04,Parent,"Oh, [inaudible 00:03:42], okay. The goat eats everything from trash to trillium. Hey, look out, he'll knock you silly. When he's bad we call him Willy. When he's good, he's just our Billy. The pig, her tail as coy as a ringlet. In her eyes there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow, I see a beauty queen. So it's like-"
43,00:04:14,2021-05-08 12:08:36,Robot,What does the pig's tail look like?
44,00:04:16,2021-05-08 12:08:38,Child,It look curly.
45,00:04:20,2021-05-08 12:08:42,Robot,You are right.
46,00:04:21,2021-05-08 12:08:43,Parent,(laughs) The snake coils-
47,00:04:28,2021-05-08 12:08:50,Child,Ss.

51,00:04:35,2021-05-08 12:08:57,Child,Ss.
52,00:04:35,2021-05-08 12:08:57,Parent,"The bees tell their story sweet and old, it begins in clover, it ends with gold. Uh, yeah. The bull know what he likes, cows and corn, knows what he is, muscle and horn. The turtle lifts her fossil head and blinks, one, two, three times in the awful light. Why is there a period and that one is not a capital? Hm. Times in the awful light. In her house it's always night. The duck-"
53,00:05:19,2021-05-08 12:09:41,Robot,I like the turtle. Is there anything you want to know about turtles?
54,00:05:24,2021-05-08 12:09:46,Child,Yes.

57,00:05:35,2021-05-08 12:09:57,Parent,"How about, how long can they hold their breath?"
58,00:05:35,2021-05-08 12:09:57,Child,How long can-
59,00:05:40,2021-05-08 12:10:02,Robot,"I like turtles, too."
60,00:05:42,2021-05-08 12:10:04,Child,How long can they hold their breath?
61,00:05:48,2021-05-08 12:10:10,Robot,Very long.
62,00:05:49,2021-05-08 12:10:11,Parent,(laughs) Long time. (laughs) Okay. The duck quack-
63,00:05:55,2021-05-08 12:10:17,Robot,Maybe over 10 minutes.
64,00:05:56,2021-05-08 12:10:18,Parent,"Ha, whoa, that's a long time. (laughs) That's why it said just 10 minutes, not 100 minutes. All right. The duck quacks, the hen squawks, and the goose honks."
65,00:06:11,2021-05-08 12:10:33,Child,(laughs).
66,00:06:11,2021-05-08 12:10:33,Parent,"But the rabbit listens, listens, listens. They don't really say anything, do they?"
67,00:06:18,2021-05-08 12:10:40,Child,"No, but they do [crosstalk 00:06:20]-"
68,00:06:18,2021-05-08 12:10:40,Parent,They just go-

70,00:06:22,2021-05-08 12:10:44,Parent,"Yeah, they just sniff around. And it does not make a sound."
71,00:06:24,2021-05-08 12:10:46,Child,"Um, yeah, no. No, they go boing, boing, boing, boing, boing-"
72,00:06:28,2021-05-08 12:10:50,Parent,"Is that what, s- they hop around and they say boing?"
73,00:06:31,2021-05-08 12:10:53,Child,Yeah.
74,00:06:34,2021-05-08 12:10:56,Parent,"(laughs) All right, what do you wanna read next?"
75,00:06:35,2021-05-08 12:10:57,Robot,That was a great story.
76,00:06:37,2021-05-08 12:10:59,Parent,(laughs).
77,00:06:40,2021-05-08 12:11:02,Robot,Want to read another one?

81,00:06:41,2021-05-08 12:11:03,Parent,(laughs) Why are you saying it like that?
82,00:06:41,2021-05-08 12:11:03,Child,(laughs).
83,00:06:41,2021-05-08 12:11:03,Parent,'Cause there's only one book?

88,00:07:01,2021-05-08 12:11:23,Child,And we have wh- white lines for that.
89,00:07:23,2021-05-08 12:11:45,Parent,"Oh, yeah. Just the artist, the way that they decided to the, the drawing. He didn't just dance, he made art with his feet."
90,00:07:23,2021-05-08 12:11:45,Child,They don't think that person's-
91,00:07:33,2021-05-08 12:11:55,Parent,"Rap-a-tap-tap, think of that."
92,00:07:36,2021-05-08 12:11:58,Child,"[crosstalk 00:07:36] um, think that person's-"

101,00:08:11,2021-05-08 12:12:33,Parent,"You did, just now. What doors are closed?"
102,00:08:16,2021-05-08 12:12:38,Child,"Mm, that one?"

107,00:08:25,2021-05-08 12:12:47,Parent,Just one?
108,00:08:27,2021-05-08 12:12:49,Child,Yeah.
109,00:08:28,2021-05-08 12:12:50,Parent,"Well, this one the person's there. Oh, but their door's... Well... Hm. Um [inaudible 00:08:44]... Rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. He danced in a place called...

It's just so they can keep warm on the street. (laughs) They're [inaudible 00:09:17]. He danced for crowds of laughing kids. Rap-a-tap-tap, think of that. Those kids wanna dance, too."

135,00:10:45,2021-05-08 12:15:07,Parent,Exactly. The people have umbrellas.
136,00:10:45,2021-05-08 12:15:07,Robot,Interesting.

138,00:10:45,2021-05-08 12:15:07,Child,(laughs).
139,00:10:50,2021-05-08 12:15:12,Parent,"It said they danced rain or shine. They're showing that, you know, the difference that it could be raining or it could be sunny, and they would still dance."
140,00:10:59,2021-05-08 12:15:21,Robot,You are right.
141,00:11:00,2021-05-08 12:15:22,Parent,(laughs) He said [inaudible 00:11:04]. People listened each day for his toe-tapping clatter. Rap-a-tap-tap... What's the next line.
142,00:11:00,2021-05-08 12:15:22,Child,Think about that.
143,00:11:10,2021-05-08 12:15:32,Parent,Think of that. He danced many rhythms that were seldom the same. Rap-a-tap-tap think of-

145,00:11:25,2021-05-08 12:15:47,Parent,Think of that. Dance was his passion and it brought him fame. Rap-a-tap-tap-

147,00:11:32,2021-05-08 12:15:54,Parent,"Think of that. Sit down, they need to see you on the camera? Remember, the camera's here? Now sit. Bojangles, Bojangles, that was his name. Rap-a-tap-tap-"
