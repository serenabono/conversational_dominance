0,00:00:00,2021-06-01 08:03:15,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:02,2021-06-01 08:03:17,Parent,Hi Jibo.
2,00:00:04,2021-06-01 08:03:19,Robot,I am now on story time mode-
3,00:00:06,2021-06-01 08:03:21,Parent,Oh.
4,00:00:06,2021-06-01 08:03:21,Robot,"... my camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. I may behave a little differently in story time mode. I will not be responding to hey Jibo, and I will not turn blue, but we can still chat. Because today is our first session, I would first like to learn how you guys read books without me. Today, I will just be listening here. Let's get started. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
5,00:00:37,2021-06-01 08:03:52,Parent,"You want, oh, wait, this is a short story or a long story. Okay. Let me pick a book. All right this is called Gerladine The Music Mouse, The Three Billy Goats Gruff, The Little Red Hen, More Three Billy Goats Gruff and Red Hen, you can swipe for more books. The Three Little Pigs, this is a book about fall..."
6,00:01:03,2021-06-01 08:04:18,Child,The Three Little Pigs.
7,00:01:04,2021-06-01 08:04:19,Parent,That one? Okay. All right. The Three Little Pigs. First page. [inaudible 00:01:21].
8,00:01:25,2021-06-01 08:04:40,Robot,Touch the bottom corners to flip.
9,00:01:30,2021-06-01 08:04:45,Parent,Hmm. He's not flipping.
10,00:01:36,2021-06-01 08:04:51,Child,"Hey, Jibo."
11,00:01:39,2021-06-01 08:04:54,Parent,We can go back to the bookshop and-
12,00:01:40,2021-06-01 08:04:55,Robot,Touch the bottom right corner.
13,00:01:44,2021-06-01 08:04:59,Parent,"There we go, okay. Once upon a time an old sow sent three little pics out in the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write"", she said, ""And remember that I love you."" What do you think a sow is?"
14,00:01:56,2021-06-01 08:05:11,Child,I don't really know. Another pig?
15,00:01:57,2021-06-01 08:05:12,Parent,"Yeah, I think you're right. Look at this little pig. The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know."" Said the pig, ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea."" Said the man. You think the man knows?"
16,00:01:57,2021-06-01 08:05:12,Child,The wolf?
17,00:02:23,2021-06-01 08:05:38,Parent,"The wolf. ""Mind your own business, thank you."" Said the little pig and he brought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all. Whoa, he's very, look at him balancing. Look at his little piggy tail."
18,00:02:23,2021-06-01 08:05:38,Child,(laughs)
19,00:02:37,2021-06-01 08:05:52,Parent,"(laughs) Soon, very soon, a lean and hungry wold happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door and said... do you remember, do you know what he says?"
20,00:02:50,2021-06-01 08:06:05,Child,I don't know.
21,00:02:50,2021-06-01 08:06:05,Parent,"""Little pig, little pig let me come in."" To which the little pig replied... do you remember?"
22,00:02:57,2021-06-01 08:06:12,Child,No.
23,00:02:58,2021-06-01 08:06:13,Parent,"""No, no, no, not by the hair on my chinny chin chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead."" Said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in and gobbled up the little pig. The second little pig met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it."" Said the little pig, ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that."" Said the man. ""Oh, pooh."" Said the little pig, ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very pretty."" He said. Do you think that a pig could lie on a stick like that? What do you think would happen?"
24,00:03:52,2021-06-01 08:07:07,Child,"Plop, bang, splat."
25,00:03:52,2021-06-01 08:07:07,Parent,"(laughs) I agree. Look at those skinny legs sticking out. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house the noble pack went by. He was still hungry and he said, ""Little pig, little pig let me come in."" To which the little pig replied..."
26,00:04:15,2021-06-01 08:07:30,Child,"Not on the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."
27,00:04:15,2021-06-01 08:07:30,Parent,"""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."""
28,00:04:21,2021-06-01 08:07:36,Child,Can you just read it?
29,00:04:22,2021-06-01 08:07:37,Parent,"Yes, I'll just read it. The wolf didn't care for that at all and he said, ""I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Huff, huff, huff."" Said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the house in and gobbled up the little pig. Now the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks, ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house."" Said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow."" Said the little pig."" So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid."" Said the little pig, ""Nice and solid."" His little piggy glasses."
30,00:05:07,2021-06-01 08:08:22,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
31,00:05:10,2021-06-01 08:08:25,Parent,But no sooner had the little pig moved in that he noticed the wolf loitering about. You know what loitering means?
32,00:05:16,2021-06-01 08:08:31,Child,No.
33,00:05:16,2021-06-01 08:08:31,Parent,What do you think it might mean?
34,00:05:18,2021-06-01 08:08:33,Child,Um...
35,00:05:19,2021-06-01 08:08:34,Parent,Well what's the pig do- what's the wolf doing?
36,00:05:22,2021-06-01 08:08:37,Child,Hunting.
37,00:05:23,2021-06-01 08:08:38,Parent,Hunting. It's kind of like waiting around outside.
38,00:05:25,2021-06-01 08:08:40,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
39,00:05:26,2021-06-01 08:08:41,Parent,'Cause what happened when he waited around outside the other houses?
40,00:05:30,2021-06-01 08:08:45,Child,"Blew them in, gobbled up the pigs."
41,00:05:30,2021-06-01 08:08:45,Parent,So what do you think he's thinking now?
42,00:05:31,2021-06-01 08:08:46,Child,He's gonna gobble up that pig.
43,00:05:33,2021-06-01 08:08:48,Parent,"He's trying to gobble up the third pig, I think you're right. And the wolf who was still hungry said, ""Little pig, little pig let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" Well, the wolf had heard that before and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh don't do that."" Said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another option, muttered the wolf."" And he put on his most dazzling smile. ""Little pig, I was only teasing."" He said. ""By the way, I hear tell that farmer James has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now."" Said the little pig, ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent."" Said the wolf, ""I'll come for you at 6:00."" What do you think the wolf's trying to do?"
44,00:05:33,2021-06-01 08:08:48,Child,Trick him to eat him.
45,00:05:33,2021-06-01 08:08:48,Parent,"What is he, how's he trying to trick him?"
46,00:06:49,2021-06-01 08:10:04,Child,Let him come outside so he can eat him.
47,00:06:50,2021-06-01 08:10:05,Parent,Since he can't get into the house?
48,00:06:52,2021-06-01 08:10:07,Child,Yeah.
49,00:06:53,2021-06-01 08:10:08,Parent,"Yeah. The next morning, the little pig got up at 5:00, hurried off to farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basked full of scrumptious turnips and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6:00, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait."" Said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done."" He said, ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree in Mary Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips."" Said the little pig, ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid."" Said the wolf, ""Shall we say at 5:00?"""
50,00:07:29,2021-06-01 08:10:44,Child,Yeah.
51,00:07:29,2021-06-01 08:10:44,Parent,Home sweet home.
52,00:07:29,2021-06-01 08:10:44,Child,Yeah.
53,00:07:37,2021-06-01 08:10:52,Parent,"The next morning the little pig was up at 4:00 and went off for the apples. It took longer than he'd expected to reach Mary Meadow. And while busy gathering apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these."" He called down throwing an apple as hard as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little big- pig, shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. The next day the wolf came again. Really he was quite put out, ""Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there."" Said the little pig, ""Would 3:00 suite you?"" ""Colossal."" Said the wolf, ""3:00 it is."" Just to make sure, he would be there at 2:00. Who goes to a fair at 2:00 in the morning?"
54,00:08:23,2021-06-01 08:11:38,Child,I don't know.
55,00:08:23,2021-06-01 08:11:38,Parent,"(laughs), Oh, maybe they meant two in the afternoon. Oh, there we go. At 1:00 in the afternoon the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly out of the corner of his eye he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Look what this says."
56,00:08:43,2021-06-01 08:11:58,Child,What?
57,00:08:45,2021-06-01 08:12:00,Parent,"Kisses. It's a kissing booth. (laughs) Prize winning butter. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the bowl. While the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home. That evening the wolf to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great round thing came down the hill. ""Frightened, you didn't hide."" Said the little pig, ""That great round thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simple too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough."" He cried, ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed into the roof... onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire. Uh oh, what do you think is gonna happen?"
58,00:09:42,2021-06-01 08:12:57,Child,He's gonna [inaudible 00:09:43].
59,00:09:42,2021-06-01 08:12:57,Parent,You think so?
60,00:09:42,2021-06-01 08:12:57,Child,Yeah.
61,00:09:46,2021-06-01 08:13:01,Parent,"""Here I come."" Cried the wolf, ""Dinner time."" ""You can say that again."" Said the little pig and he cooked that mean old wolf and gobbled him up. The end. Can you click the bookshelf? The one there."
62,00:09:46,2021-06-01 08:13:01,Child,Bookshelf.
63,00:10:01,2021-06-01 08:13:16,Parent,"Okay can you pick another one? Wait, wait, wait."
64,00:10:02,2021-06-01 08:13:17,Child,There.
65,00:10:04,2021-06-01 08:13:19,Parent,"Well let's, there might be more the other way. You want... oh, that one? Okay. Gerladine."
66,00:10:04,2021-06-01 08:13:19,Child,Actually.
67,00:10:10,2021-06-01 08:13:25,Parent,"No. Let's see, what don't we just see what other books there are."
68,00:10:10,2021-06-01 08:13:25,Child,"Oh, look."
69,00:10:30,2021-06-01 08:13:45,Parent,"Oh, hold on. Just [inaudible 00:10:30]. Let's see."
70,00:10:30,2021-06-01 08:13:45,Child,Is that moles? I want Three Little Pigs and that one.
71,00:10:37,2021-06-01 08:13:52,Parent,"Three Billy Goats Gruff, okay."
72,00:10:37,2021-06-01 08:13:52,Child,Yeah.
73,00:10:40,2021-06-01 08:13:55,Parent,The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Are you okay there?
74,00:10:40,2021-06-01 08:13:55,Child,Yes.
75,00:10:43,2021-06-01 08:13:58,Parent,"All right. Once upon a time there were three Billy Goats Gruff. There was a little billy goat gruff, a middle sized billy goat gruff and a big billy goat gruff. Look at all these colors. Which is your favorite color goat? The big one?"
76,00:10:59,2021-06-01 08:14:14,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
77,00:11:00,2021-06-01 08:14:15,Parent,"Why do you like the big one? Come on, we gotta hurry. You can touch it when it's time. The three Bill Goats Gruff lived in a field and they spent their days munching the green grass. On one side of the field there was a stream and over the stream there was a rickety bridge. Press this corner gently, just tap. On the other side of the rickety bridge there was a hill and there was a [inaudible 00:11:21] and there the grass grew greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the Billy Goats Gruff. Can you press it?"
78,00:11:25,2021-06-01 08:14:40,Child,Okay.
79,00:11:25,2021-06-01 08:14:40,Parent,"Under that rickety bridge lived a big hairy troll in a deep dark hole that was damp and cold under the bridge and that made the troll furious, he was also hungry."
80,00:11:42,2021-06-01 08:14:57,Child,For what?
81,00:11:42,2021-06-01 08:14:57,Parent,What do you think?
82,00:11:42,2021-06-01 08:14:57,Child,Goats.
83,00:11:42,2021-06-01 08:14:57,Parent,Goats.
84,00:11:42,2021-06-01 08:14:57,Child,Yeah.
85,00:11:48,2021-06-01 08:15:03,Parent,I think he's probably hungry maybe for anything. But goats would be extra delicious.
86,00:11:48,2021-06-01 08:15:03,Child,Yeah.
87,00:11:54,2021-06-01 08:15:09,Parent,"One day the little billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass on the hill, up the hill on the other side of the stream was very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said, ""Then I'll grow big and fat."" So trip, trap, trip, trap went the hooves of the lit- little billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. The big hairy troll woke up with a start, ""Who's that criss crossing my bridge?"" He roared. ""I am."" Said the little billy goat gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" It looks like he's way behind him. ""Oh no you're not."" Said the big hairy troll, ""I am a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh don't do that."" Said the litt- little billy goat gruff, ""I am only small, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much bigger."" And he stepped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Oh, that sneaky little goat. Just then the middle sized billy goat gruff looked up and he saw it too, saw that the grass was on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said, ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip, trap, trip, trap went the hooves of the middle sized billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big hairy troll. ""I am."" Said the middle sized billy goat gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not."" Said the big hairy troll. You know who he kind of looks like?"
88,00:11:54,2021-06-01 08:15:09,Child,No.
89,00:13:52,2021-06-01 08:17:07,Parent,The [gruffalob 00:13:52]. What do you think?
90,00:13:52,2021-06-01 08:17:07,Child,Yeah.
91,00:14:01,2021-06-01 08:17:16,Parent,"""I'm a troll from a deep dark hold. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh don't do that."" Said the middle size billy goat gruff, ""I'm not very big, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he's much, much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the big billy goat gruff looked up and he too saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course."" He said, ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter, then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip, trap, trip, trap went the hooves of the big billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge."
92,00:14:55,2021-06-01 08:18:10,Child,"But, the troll [inaudible 00:14:59]."
93,00:15:00,2021-06-01 08:18:15,Parent,You think the troll's gonna get this one?
94,00:15:01,2021-06-01 08:18:16,Child,Yeah.
95,00:15:02,2021-06-01 08:18:17,Parent,"Well, two other goats went away."
96,00:15:04,2021-06-01 08:18:19,Child,Yeah.
97,00:15:04,2021-06-01 08:18:19,Parent,He must be very hungry now.
98,00:15:07,2021-06-01 08:18:22,Child,Yeah.
99,00:15:09,2021-06-01 08:18:24,Parent,"""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big hairy troll. ""I am."" Said the big billy goat gruff, ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream. ""Oh no you're not."" Said the big hairy troll."
100,00:15:09,2021-06-01 08:18:24,Child,"Look it, folded."
101,00:15:30,2021-06-01 08:18:45,Parent,"Oh, okay watch this part, all right. ""I'm a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my..."
102,00:15:39,2021-06-01 08:18:54,Child,Dinner.
103,00:15:40,2021-06-01 08:18:55,Parent,"... dinner."" The big billy goat gruff stopped. His knees shook, his hooves trembled, clickety clack, clickety clack on the rickety bridge. Then he pulls himself together. ""I don't think you will."" He said and he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. That's a big kick."
104,00:16:07,2021-06-01 08:19:22,Child,Like...
105,00:16:07,2021-06-01 08:19:22,Parent,Then the billy goat gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big harry trolls... stop picking your nose. As for the big hairy trolls... stop. As for the big hairy troll I was happy to say that he was never seen again. The end. Why don't we go to bookshelf?
106,00:16:36,2021-06-01 08:19:51,Robot,That was a great story.
107,00:16:36,2021-06-01 08:19:51,Parent,(laughs).
108,00:16:43,2021-06-01 08:19:58,Robot,That's it for today's session. Good job. I had so much fun.
109,00:16:48,2021-06-01 08:20:03,Parent,Did you have fun too?
110,00:16:49,2021-06-01 08:20:04,Robot,"I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey and sign up for the next session."
