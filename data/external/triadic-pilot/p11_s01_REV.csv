0,00:00:02,2021-06-03 08:57:14,Parent,Hi Jibo.
1,00:00:03,2021-06-03 08:57:15,Robot,"I am now on Storytime mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Storytime app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
2,00:00:28,2021-06-03 08:57:40,Parent,What kind do you want? Short stories or long stories?
3,00:00:28,2021-06-03 08:57:40,Child,Long.
4,00:00:29,2021-06-03 08:57:41,Parent,"Okay. Go down. What, did you want to read that one? Geraldine the Music Mouse? Or do you want to see more?"
5,00:00:29,2021-06-03 08:57:41,Child,More. Hmm... The Three Little Pigs.
6,00:00:47,2021-06-03 08:57:59,Parent,"Well let's read this, see what else there is."
7,00:00:47,2021-06-03 08:57:59,Child,"There's more than that one. Ah, Geraldine the Music Mouse."
8,00:00:58,2021-06-03 08:58:10,Parent,Okay. Geraldine the Music Mouse. By Leo Lionni. What do you think that's made out of?
9,00:01:05,2021-06-03 08:58:17,Child,Cheese.
10,00:01:05,2021-06-03 08:58:17,Parent,You think so?
11,00:01:05,2021-06-03 08:58:17,Child,(laughs)
12,00:01:08,2021-06-03 08:58:20,Parent,"Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. And of course, the soft squeaking of mice. But music? Never. Then one morning, in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bit from it. It was delicious! But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the bar? Do you like cheese?"
13,00:01:52,2021-06-03 08:59:04,Robot,The cheese is enormous. What does enormous mean?
14,00:01:55,2021-06-03 08:59:07,Child,Huge. It means big.
15,00:02:05,2021-06-03 08:59:17,Robot,Terrific.
16,00:02:07,2021-06-03 08:59:19,Parent,"You got a heart. How do you think she can take it to the barn? Sweep it into the dust pan? Do you think she can carry the dust pan, though?"
17,00:02:21,2021-06-03 08:59:33,Child,No.
18,00:02:22,2021-06-03 08:59:34,Parent,"We'll see. Let's see what happens. She ran to her friends who live next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who love cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go"" they said, and off they went. How many mices?"
19,00:02:42,2021-06-03 08:59:54,Child,"One, two, three, four, five. Six."
20,00:02:51,2021-06-03 09:00:03,Parent,"Six including Geraldine. ""It's enormous! It's gigantic! It's immense! It's fantastic"" they shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. Look at that. (laughs) There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into and pulled away crumb after crumb and chunk after chunk. (laughs) Do you see the cheese on Jibo? (laughs)"
21,00:03:27,2021-06-03 09:00:39,Child,(laughs)
22,00:03:31,2021-06-03 09:00:43,Parent,"You're sillier than me. Sit up. As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There she saw the shape of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. Do you see that?"
23,00:03:31,2021-06-03 09:00:43,Child,Ears!
24,00:03:50,2021-06-03 09:01:02,Parent,"As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw."
25,00:04:03,2021-06-03 09:01:15,Child,She's sculpted it.
26,00:04:05,2021-06-03 09:01:17,Parent,"She's sculpting it, yeah. She's making a sculpture ind, in the noun. She's sculpting when she's actually doing it."
27,00:04:05,2021-06-03 09:01:17,Child,Yeah.
28,00:04:14,2021-06-03 09:01:26,Parent,"The ear, those, the ears were those of a giant mouse still partly hidden of solid cheese. To it's puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse."
29,00:04:29,2021-06-03 09:01:41,Robot,What do you think the mouse in the cheese will do?
30,00:04:34,2021-06-03 09:01:46,Child,[inaudible 00:04:34] music.
31,00:04:40,2021-06-03 09:01:52,Parent,"Yeah, 'cause she's got a flute for a tail. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouses' tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sound. It seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clear and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and globe. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music!"" she thought. Pay attention. ""This must be music!"" She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window pane. [inaudible 00:05:41] But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light [crosstalk 00:05:45] the music became..."
32,00:05:54,2021-06-03 09:03:06,Child,Do you think I [inaudible 00:05:57]
33,00:05:57,2021-06-03 09:03:09,Parent,"Let's finish reading and then we'll see. Okay? I think so. Uh, but as [crosstalk 00:06:00]"
34,00:06:00,2021-06-03 09:03:12,Child,This is basically [inaudible 00:06:00].
35,00:05:59,2021-06-03 09:03:11,Parent,"(laughs) But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play, play!"" Geraldine begged. Put this away [crosstalk 00:06:10]."
36,00:06:12,2021-06-03 09:03:24,Robot,"Time for a question. Ken, can you ask us a question about cheese mouse?"
37,00:06:23,2021-06-03 09:03:35,Parent,Do you have any questions?
38,00:06:23,2021-06-03 09:03:35,Child,"One question. Does the, does the cheese mouse mold?"
39,00:06:30,2021-06-03 09:03:42,Robot,You know the answer.
40,00:06:33,2021-06-03 09:03:45,Parent,You know the answer to that.
41,00:06:33,2021-06-03 09:03:45,Child,No.
42,00:06:35,2021-06-03 09:03:47,Parent,You're being silly. I have a question.
43,00:06:35,2021-06-03 09:03:47,Child,What?
44,00:06:39,2021-06-03 09:03:51,Parent,What song does the cheese mouse play? What do you think?
45,00:06:39,2021-06-03 09:03:51,Child,I don't know.
46,00:06:47,2021-06-03 09:03:59,Parent,"""Play some more."" But not, uh, not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again? Geraldine thought as she gobbled some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. [crosstalk 00:07:11] Okay, but we're reading right now. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies and even in daylight they lingered in her ears. Then one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine"" they said. ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""But that is not possible."" Uh-oh. Look, angry mice. How do you think Geraldine feels? [crosstalk 00:07:48]"
47,00:06:47,2021-06-03 09:03:59,Child,Bad.
48,00:07:48,2021-06-03 09:05:00,Parent,"Yeah, I don't think that feels good to have people mad at you. Geraldine shouted.  ""Why?"" Geraldine shouted.  ""Why?"" asked the others angrily. ""Because, because, because it's in his music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine surprised. ""What is music?"" they asked all together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath, and blew. You think she can play music on her tail?"
49,00:07:48,2021-06-03 09:05:00,Child,Yeah.
50,00:08:17,2021-06-03 09:05:29,Parent,Yeah?
51,00:08:18,2021-06-03 09:05:30,Child,Yeah.
52,00:08:19,2021-06-03 09:05:31,Parent,"Let's see. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she squeaked. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. Oh, poor Geraldine. Then, a long, soft beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. I wonder what they call the mouse, mice now. Other mice came to hear the music. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered if this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."
53,00:09:02,2021-06-03 09:06:14,Robot,Why do you think Gregory said that they cannot eat the cheese mouse?
54,00:09:05,2021-06-03 09:06:17,Child,"Because, um, it's music."
55,00:09:16,2021-06-03 09:06:28,Robot,No thank you Pennsylvania. I learned something.
56,00:09:21,2021-06-03 09:06:33,Parent,"""No"" said Geraldine joyfully. ""Now we can eat the cheese."" [crosstalk 00:09:25]"
57,00:09:25,2021-06-03 09:06:37,Child,[inaudible 00:09:25]
58,00:09:24,2021-06-03 09:06:36,Parent,"(laughs) Silly Jibo. Okay. Let's read. Let's finish the story. ""Now"" said Geraldine joyfully, ""Now we can eat the cheese because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine was whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. The end. Wanna go back to the bookshelf?"
59,00:09:24,2021-06-03 09:06:36,Child,Bookshelf.
60,00:10:00,2021-06-03 09:07:12,Parent,Wanna pick another one?
61,00:10:06,2021-06-03 09:07:18,Child,Yeah. [crosstalk 00:10:06]
62,00:10:06,2021-06-03 09:07:18,Robot,That was a great story.
63,00:10:06,2021-06-03 09:07:18,Child,(laughs)
64,00:10:06,2021-06-03 09:07:18,Parent,(laughs)
65,00:10:08,2021-06-03 09:07:20,Robot,Want to read another one?
66,00:10:08,2021-06-03 09:07:20,Parent,Wanna read another one?
67,00:10:11,2021-06-03 09:07:23,Child,Sure.
68,00:10:12,2021-06-03 09:07:24,Parent,"Yeah. Okay, this one's called Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. This is called on the farm. On the, on the farm. Go ahead. On the farm. What do you think this is about?"
69,00:10:22,2021-06-03 09:07:34,Child,A mouse.
70,00:10:24,2021-06-03 09:07:36,Parent,"A mouse? Let's see. The rooster crows and struts. He's got feathers. He's got guts. Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows. What does the rooster say?"
71,00:10:24,2021-06-03 09:07:36,Child,Cock-a-doodle-doo.
72,00:10:41,2021-06-03 09:07:53,Parent,"The cow makes milk standing grazing, abracadabra, she's utterly amazing."
73,00:10:41,2021-06-03 09:07:53,Child,Utterly awesome and utterly amazing.
74,00:10:51,2021-06-03 09:08:03,Parent,"Let's look at the pony. The pony whinnies in the wind, kicks in his stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall. The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shady farmhouse yard. You might think he's keeping cool. Beware, he's keeping guard. What do you think he's guarding?"
75,00:10:51,2021-06-03 09:08:03,Child,The animals.
76,00:11:16,2021-06-03 09:08:28,Parent,"The animals. Maybe the kids, too. The sheep began his wooly life as gentle as a lamb. Too bad he turned into a ram. Bam!"
77,00:11:33,2021-06-03 09:08:45,Robot,Could you please ask us an open-ended question about lamb?
78,00:11:40,2021-06-03 09:08:52,Parent,That means like can you ask a question that you can't answer with a yes or a now.
79,00:11:44,2021-06-03 09:08:56,Child,Um. Does a Peloton wheel spin?
80,00:11:50,2021-06-03 09:09:02,Parent,"About the book, honey."
81,00:11:54,2021-06-03 09:09:06,Child,Uh... Do apples fall from the sky?
82,00:11:58,2021-06-03 09:09:10,Robot,I like this question.
83,00:12:05,2021-06-03 09:09:17,Parent,(laughs)
84,00:12:07,2021-06-03 09:09:19,Child,Do apples [crosstalk 00:12:09]?
85,00:12:09,2021-06-03 09:09:21,Parent,"Well, let's worry the book. I think they're thinking about sheep. The barn cat might have better think twice. See the cat. Look at these sneaky mice. The goats eat everything from trash to [inaudible 00:12:25]. Hey, look out. He's not... He'll knock you silly. When he's bad, we call him William. When he's good, he's just our Billy. [inaudible 00:12:39] A pig, her tail as coy as a ringlet. In her eyes there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow, I see a beauty queen. [crosstalk 00:12:47] The snake coils in the garden like a spring or the wild and winding melody he hears but cannot sing."
86,00:13:04,2021-06-03 09:10:16,Robot,How does a snake coil?
87,00:13:05,2021-06-03 09:10:17,Child,He wraps himself round and round.
88,00:13:12,2021-06-03 09:10:24,Parent,That's right.
89,00:13:12,2021-06-03 09:10:24,Child,There's a bee.
90,00:13:16,2021-06-03 09:10:28,Parent,"The bees tell their stories sweet and old, it began in some clover, it ends with gold. What's the gold? [crosstalk 00:13:27] What do bees make? What kind of golden color?"
91,00:13:29,2021-06-03 09:10:41,Child,Honey.
92,00:13:29,2021-06-03 09:10:41,Parent,"Yeah, honey. The bull, he knows... Honey, that's distracting because you can't even hold them. The bull knows what he likes, cows and corn, knows what he is, multiple and horn. The turtle lifts her fossil head and blinks, one, two, three times in the awful... One, two, three times in the awful light. In her house, it's always night. The duck, the duck quacks. The hen squawks. The goose honks. But the rabbit listens, listens, listens. Those bunnies are cute."
93,00:14:11,2021-06-03 09:11:23,Child,Yeah.
94,00:14:13,2021-06-03 09:11:25,Parent,And doesn't make a sound. The end. [crosstalk 00:14:15] Hold on. Want to see what other books there are?
95,00:14:27,2021-06-03 09:11:39,Robot,What did you learn about the story?
96,00:14:28,2021-06-03 09:11:40,Child,Apples fall from the sky.
97,00:14:34,2021-06-03 09:11:46,Parent,Honey. Be serious please. What did you learn?
98,00:14:37,2021-06-03 09:11:49,Child,Nothing.
99,00:14:39,2021-06-03 09:11:51,Parent,"There's a lot of different animals on a farm, maybe? All right."
100,00:14:55,2021-06-03 09:12:07,Robot,Which animal do you like most?
101,00:14:56,2021-06-03 09:12:08,Parent,Which animal do you like the most?
102,00:14:57,2021-06-03 09:12:09,Child,Uh...
103,00:14:57,2021-06-03 09:12:09,Parent,Sit up.
104,00:14:57,2021-06-03 09:12:09,Child,Uh... Uh... Uh...
105,00:15:02,2021-06-03 09:12:14,Parent,That we read about. Which animal do you like the most?
106,00:15:04,2021-06-03 09:12:16,Child,Uh... the fluffy.
107,00:15:09,2021-06-03 09:12:21,Parent,Which one?
108,00:15:11,2021-06-03 09:12:23,Robot,Cat?
109,00:15:13,2021-06-03 09:12:25,Parent,"The cat, yeah."
110,00:15:20,2021-06-03 09:12:32,Child,The cat and [crosstalk 00:15:20] The cat and the sheep.
111,00:15:27,2021-06-03 09:12:39,Robot,Wow sheep. Baa.
112,00:15:27,2021-06-03 09:12:39,Child,Wow sheep.
113,00:15:37,2021-06-03 09:12:49,Parent,You like sheep?
114,00:15:38,2021-06-03 09:12:50,Child,"No, just [inaudible 00:15:38]."
115,00:15:38,2021-06-03 09:12:50,Parent,(laughs)
116,00:15:42,2021-06-03 09:12:54,Child,"No, I didn't see the sheep."
117,00:15:47,2021-06-03 09:12:59,Parent,We saw him. All right. Do you want to pick another book? Three Billy Goats Gruff again?
118,00:15:47,2021-06-03 09:12:59,Child,Yeah.
119,00:15:56,2021-06-03 09:13:08,Parent,Okay. [crosstalk 00:15:56] We're gonna read one more book. You need to put this stuff away [crosstalk 00:15:59].
120,00:15:56,2021-06-03 09:13:08,Child,Okay.
121,00:15:59,2021-06-03 09:13:11,Parent,"Okay. And if Jibo answers, asks you any questions, we need you to act seri, answer seriously."
122,00:16:07,2021-06-03 09:13:19,Child,Okay.
123,00:16:08,2021-06-03 09:13:20,Parent,"Okay? Let's read Billy Goats Gruff. Once upon a time there were three billy goats gruff. There was a little billy goat gruff, a middle-size billy goat gruff, and a big b, billy goat gruff.  The three billy goats gruff lived in a field and they spent their days munching the green grass. One side of the field, there was a stream. And over the stream there was a rickety bridge. On the other side of the rickety bridge there was a hill. And there was grass... And there the grass grew greener and sweater than it did in the field of the billy goats gruff. No, come on. Enough. [crosstalk 00:16:45] Under the rickety bridge lived a big hairy troll in a deep dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge and that made the troll furious. He was also..."
124,00:16:59,2021-06-03 09:14:11,Child,Hungry.
125,00:17:02,2021-06-03 09:14:14,Parent,Hungry.
126,00:17:04,2021-06-03 09:14:16,Child,For billy goat gruff.
127,00:17:05,2021-06-03 09:14:17,Parent,"For billy goat gruff. One day the little billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass on the hill on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course"" he said. ""Then I'll grow big and fat."" So trip-trap, trip-trap when the hooves of the little billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge."
128,00:17:28,2021-06-03 09:14:40,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up here?
129,00:17:30,2021-06-03 09:14:42,Parent,Can you think of any questions?
130,00:17:30,2021-06-03 09:14:42,Child,No.
131,00:17:30,2021-06-03 09:14:42,Robot,Any story questions?
132,00:17:43,2021-06-03 09:14:55,Child,No.
133,00:17:46,2021-06-03 09:14:58,Parent,Do you think the troll will get the little billy goat gruff?
134,00:17:48,2021-06-03 09:15:00,Robot,I want to learn something from you.
135,00:17:50,2021-06-03 09:15:02,Parent,Can you please focus and listen to Jibo? [inaudible 00:17:59] Maybe if we keep reading we'll come up with some story. [inaudible 00:18:08] The big hairy troll...
136,00:17:50,2021-06-03 09:15:02,Robot,Maybe next time.
137,00:18:12,2021-06-03 09:15:24,Parent,"The big hairy troll woke up with a start. ""Who is that crossing my bridge?"" he roared. Then hold them in your hand and stop playing with them on the table please, it's distracting."
138,00:18:24,2021-06-03 09:15:36,Child,Okay.
139,00:18:24,2021-06-03 09:15:36,Parent,"Listen to the story please. ""Who's that criss-crossing my bridge?"" he roared. ""I am"" said the little billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not"" said the big hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh don't do that"" said the little billy goat gruff. ""I'm only small, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother. He's much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the middle-sized billy goat gruff looked up, and he, too, saw that the grass from the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll mo, move over there for my next course"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip-tap, trip-tap went the hooves of the middle-sized billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" roared the big hairy troll. ""I am"" said the middle billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not"" said the big, hairy troll. Honey, [inaudible 00:19:37] get up, come on, sit right here. Get up."
140,00:19:45,2021-06-03 09:16:57,Child,[inaudible 00:19:45]
141,00:19:47,2021-06-03 09:16:59,Parent,"No, you dropped that. Come on. ""I'm a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner, I need to eat, and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh don't do that..."""
142,00:19:57,2021-06-03 09:17:09,Robot,"Pennsylvania, is the troll nice to the middle size Billy goat?"
143,00:20:00,2021-06-03 09:17:12,Parent,Is the troll nice?
144,00:20:00,2021-06-03 09:17:12,Child,No.
145,00:20:07,2021-06-03 09:17:19,Parent,"""Oh, don't do that"" said the middle-sized billy goat gruff. ""I'm not very big. I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother. He's much, much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the big billy goat gruff looked up, and he, too, saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip-tap, trip-tap went the hooves of the big billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" roared the big hairy troll. ""I am"" said the big billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep dark hole. My belly's getting thinner, I need to eat, and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my..."
146,00:21:06,2021-06-03 09:18:18,Child,Dinner.
147,00:21:06,2021-06-03 09:18:18,Parent,"Dinner."" The big billy goat gruff stopped. His knees shook, his hooves trembled, clickity clack, clickity clack on the rickety bridge. Then he pulled himself together. ""I don't think you will"" he said. And he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. [crosstalk 00:21:28] Then the billy goat gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big hairy troll, I am happy to say that he was never seen again."
148,00:21:42,2021-06-03 09:18:54,Robot,How did three billy goats not get eaten by the troll?
149,00:21:42,2021-06-03 09:18:54,Parent,How did they not get eaten by the troll? Be serious.
150,00:21:42,2021-06-03 09:18:54,Child,They tricked him.
151,00:21:42,2021-06-03 09:18:54,Parent,"They tricked him. All right. I think, I think you're done with this."
152,00:21:42,2021-06-03 09:18:54,Child,Yeah.
153,00:22:04,2021-06-03 09:19:16,Parent,Want to be done?
154,00:22:05,2021-06-03 09:19:17,Child,Yeah.
155,00:22:05,2021-06-03 09:19:17,Parent,Yeah.
156,00:22:14,2021-06-03 09:19:26,Child,[inaudible 00:22:14]
157,00:22:13,2021-06-03 09:19:25,Parent,Yeah. I think that's enough reading for today.
158,00:22:20,2021-06-03 09:19:32,Child,Jibo.
159,00:22:20,2021-06-03 09:19:32,Robot,"That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
