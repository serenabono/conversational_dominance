1,00:00:03,2021-06-11 08:24:55,Parent,[crosstalk 00:00:03] Hi Jibo. [crosstalk 00:00:05]
2,00:00:04,2021-06-11 08:24:56,Robot,"I am now on Storytime mode.  [crosstalk 00:00:07] My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Storytime app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
3,00:00:25,2021-06-11 08:25:17,Parent,"Okay, come on. Ready?"
4,00:00:25,2021-06-11 08:25:17,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
5,00:00:26,2021-06-11 08:25:18,Parent,Can you say good morning to Jibo?
6,00:00:37,2021-06-11 08:25:29,Child,Good morning Jibo.
7,00:00:49,2021-06-11 08:25:41,Parent,You don't want to read that power book?
8,00:00:49,2021-06-11 08:25:41,Child,Hm-mmm (negative).
9,00:00:49,2021-06-11 08:25:41,Parent,Okay.
10,00:00:49,2021-06-11 08:25:41,Child,I want the one with the dog and the red...
11,00:00:51,2021-06-11 08:25:43,Parent,The little red hen? Okay.
12,00:00:51,2021-06-11 08:25:43,Child,Um.
13,00:00:51,2021-06-11 08:25:43,Parent,"Ready? The Little Red Hen, by Jerry Pinkney. You okay?"
14,00:00:51,2021-06-11 08:25:43,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
15,00:00:52,2021-06-11 08:25:44,Parent,"The little red hen greeted the sun with a cheery, ""Good morning."" It was going to be another busy day. While hunting for worms and berries for her young ones, she came upon some strange seeds. Ever so carefully, she scooped them up, then headed home. On the way, she greeted her neighbors, the short brown dog, the thin gray rat, the tall black goat, and the round pig. ""I found these seeds,"" she said."
16,00:01:21,2021-06-11 08:26:13,Child,A round pink pig.
17,00:01:23,2021-06-11 08:26:15,Parent,"You're right, the round pink pig. Good memory. Who do we have? We've got pig, the dog, the rat, [crosstalk 00:01:32] goat, and they go on. ""Can any of you tell me what they are?"" ""They're wheat seeds,"" said one of the animals. ""If you plant them, they'll grow into wheat for baking bread."""
18,00:01:43,2021-06-11 08:26:35,Child,Hey Jibo. Jibo?
19,00:01:43,2021-06-11 08:26:35,Parent,He's listening.
20,00:01:49,2021-06-11 08:26:41,Child,Have you ever... [crosstalk 00:01:49]
21,00:01:49,2021-06-11 08:26:41,Robot,Yes.
22,00:01:48,2021-06-11 08:26:40,Child,...made a bread? Jibo? Hey Jibo?
23,00:01:51,2021-06-11 08:26:43,Robot,Yes.
24,00:01:52,2021-06-11 08:26:44,Child,Have you ever made bread?
25,00:02:16,2021-06-11 08:27:08,Robot,No. Have you?
26,00:02:18,2021-06-11 08:27:10,Child,Yeah.
27,00:02:26,2021-06-11 08:27:18,Parent,Okay. What kind of bread have we made?
28,00:02:26,2021-06-11 08:27:18,Child,Banana bread.
29,00:02:27,2021-06-11 08:27:19,Parent,Banana bread.
30,00:02:28,2021-06-11 08:27:20,Robot,Was it fun to make it?
31,00:02:30,2021-06-11 08:27:22,Child,Yeah.
32,00:02:33,2021-06-11 08:27:25,Parent,"""Who will help and me plant these seeds?"""
33,00:02:35,2021-06-11 08:27:27,Robot,Cool.
34,00:02:35,2021-06-11 08:27:27,Parent,"Asked the little red hen. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Surely you will"" the little red hen said to the dog. ""You are so fond of digging."" ""Not I"" said the dog. [inaudible 00:02:49] Silly. ""Very well then"" said the little red hen. ""I will plant them myself."" She dug holes in the ground and dropped the seeds in. A very busy hen she was, was she. Every day, the little red hen scratched for food to feed her young ones. She also found time to care for the seedlings. She and her chicks watched as the wheat grew strong and ripe. ""It is now time for harvesting"" said the little red hen. ""Who will help me cut and thresh the wheat?"" she asked. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Not I"" said the dog. ""Surely you will"" the little red hen said to the rat. ""You can use your tail to chop it easily."" ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Very well, then. I will do it myself"" said the little red hen. After snipping the stalks with her beak she separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen she, was she. Those are lazy animals, huh?"
35,00:03:53,2021-06-11 08:28:45,Child,Yeah.
36,00:03:53,2021-06-11 08:28:45,Parent,"""Who will help me take the grain to the mill"" asked the little red hen. ""Not I"" said the pig. ""Not I"" said the dog. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Surely you will"" the little red hen said to the goat. ""You are strong and steady and it's a lovely day to take out your cart. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Very well, then"" said the little red hen. ""I will do it myself."" So she fetched her shawl and then trudged off to the mill. Mr. Miller ground her grain into flour and even gave her a jar of berry jam. The little red hen thanked him and began her long trek home. Do you remembered what trudged means?"
37,00:04:32,2021-06-11 08:29:24,Child,Go slowly.
38,00:04:35,2021-06-11 08:29:27,Parent,"Right. And like heavily and slowly. [crosstalk 00:04:38] Because of the jam. And it was a long walk, right? Yeah. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" asked the little red hen. ""Not I"" said the dog. ""Not I"" said the rat. ""Not I"" said the goat. ""Surely you will"" the little red hen said to the pig. ""It won't take much effort at all and you are always delighted with my cooking."" ""Not I"" said the pig. Look, they're getting bigger, huh?"
39,00:04:35,2021-06-11 08:29:27,Child,Yeah.
40,00:05:06,2021-06-11 08:29:58,Parent,"""Very well, then"" said the little red hen. ""I will do it myself."" She mixed the flour with yeast, salt, and water, then kneaded the dough, shaped it into a loaf, and put it into the oven. [inaudible 00:05:17]"
41,00:05:16,2021-06-11 08:30:08,Child,Yeah. [inaudible 00:05:17]
42,00:05:16,2021-06-11 08:30:08,Parent,I think... What do you think he's doing?
43,00:05:25,2021-06-11 08:30:17,Child,Smelling.
44,00:05:27,2021-06-11 08:30:19,Parent,Right?
45,00:05:28,2021-06-11 08:30:20,Child,Yeah.
46,00:05:28,2021-06-11 08:30:20,Parent,"At last, the bread was done. As the little red hen took the hot loaf out of the oven, a tasty aroma circled the barnyard."
47,00:05:35,2021-06-11 08:30:27,Child,Aroma.
48,00:05:35,2021-06-11 08:30:27,Parent,Do you remember what that means?
49,00:05:35,2021-06-11 08:30:27,Child,Smell.
50,00:05:42,2021-06-11 08:30:34,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Everyone's smelling it, huh?"
51,00:05:44,2021-06-11 08:30:36,Child,Yeah.
52,00:05:44,2021-06-11 08:30:36,Parent,"Look, oh, you can almost see it."
53,00:05:47,2021-06-11 08:30:39,Child,Yeah.
54,00:05:51,2021-06-11 08:30:43,Parent,"""I know who will eat the golden bread"" said the little red hen. ""I surely will"" said the short brown dog. ""I surely will"" said the thin gray rat. ""I surely will"" said the tall black goat. ""I surely will"" said the round pink pig. ""Oh no you won't"" said the little red hen. ""You did not help me plant the seeds, nor thresh the wheat, nor take the grain to the miller, nor bake the bread."" The end. Would you have shared your bread?"
55,00:05:51,2021-06-11 08:30:43,Child,No.
56,00:06:18,2021-06-11 08:31:10,Parent,No? If you did all the work. Should we ask Jibo?
57,00:06:18,2021-06-11 08:31:10,Child,What?
58,00:06:18,2021-06-11 08:31:10,Parent,Should we ask Jibo if he would share the bread?
59,00:06:18,2021-06-11 08:31:10,Child,Hey Jibo.
60,00:06:18,2021-06-11 08:31:10,Robot,Yes.
61,00:06:19,2021-06-11 08:31:11,Child,Would you share your bread if you did all the work?
62,00:06:42,2021-06-11 08:31:34,Robot,Maybe.
63,00:06:45,2021-06-11 08:31:37,Parent,I'd have to think about it [crosstalk 00:06:45]
64,00:06:47,2021-06-11 08:31:39,Robot,Will you? Will you share your bread?
65,00:06:47,2021-06-11 08:31:39,Child,Yeah.
66,00:06:49,2021-06-11 08:31:41,Parent,Yeah?
67,00:06:49,2021-06-11 08:31:41,Child,With Jibo?
68,00:06:50,2021-06-11 08:31:42,Parent,(laughs) aw.
69,00:06:50,2021-06-11 08:31:42,Robot,Why?
70,00:06:53,2021-06-11 08:31:45,Parent,Why would you share it?
71,00:06:56,2021-06-11 08:31:48,Child,I don't know.
72,00:06:57,2021-06-11 08:31:49,Parent,Because it's the nice thing to do maybe?
73,00:07:01,2021-06-11 08:31:53,Child,Yeah.
74,00:07:02,2021-06-11 08:31:54,Robot,It is so kind of you.
75,00:07:05,2021-06-11 08:31:57,Parent,"All right. The Three Little Pigs. This is, oh, we haven't, have we read this one yet?"
76,00:07:05,2021-06-11 08:31:57,Robot,Hm-mmm (negative).
77,00:07:11,2021-06-11 08:32:03,Parent,"Oh good. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. Which one do you think is gonna be the one to build the straw, stick, or bricks?"
78,00:07:11,2021-06-11 08:32:03,Child,Bricks.
79,00:07:25,2021-06-11 08:32:17,Parent,Bricks?
80,00:07:26,2021-06-11 08:32:18,Child,"Yeah. Sticks, straw."
81,00:07:32,2021-06-11 08:32:24,Parent,"All right, we'll see. One day, mother pig said ""You are all grown up now, it is time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong and you will be save from the big bad wolf."" The first little pig was a lazy little pig. He built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong. The second little big was a playful little pig. He built his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to Mother's advice and built the strong house of bricks. The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry and for his supper he wanted a pig. Does he look like a nice well-formed mean wolf."
82,00:08:33,2021-06-11 08:33:25,Child,Yeah.
83,00:08:35,2021-06-11 08:33:27,Parent,"The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in"" he roared. ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin"" replied the first little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in"" growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. Next, the wolf knocked on the second little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny, chin, chin"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" [crosstalk 00:09:41]"
84,00:08:35,2021-06-11 08:33:27,Child,I thought it was blow your house down.
85,00:09:41,2021-06-11 08:34:33,Parent,"Well, in this book, it's blow your house down. But you're right, in different books, like in different versions of the same book, the words can be a little different."
86,00:09:41,2021-06-11 08:34:33,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
87,00:09:43,2021-06-11 08:34:35,Parent,"Right?  So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. ""The big bad wolf blew our houses down"" they cried. ""Quick, come inside"" said their brother. Minutes later there was a knock on the door. Who do you think it could be?"
88,00:09:43,2021-06-11 08:34:35,Child,The big bad wolf.
89,00:10:08,2021-06-11 08:35:00,Parent,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" ""Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin"" said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed and puffed, then he puffed and he huffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down. The big bad wolf was very angry. ""I'll get you little piggies"" he snarled. He climbed up on the roof and crept toward the chimney. Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with hot crackling flames. Uh-oh. How do you think that felt?"
90,00:10:08,2021-06-11 08:35:00,Child,Ouchy.
91,00:10:57,2021-06-11 08:35:49,Parent,Ouchy. The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again.
92,00:11:06,2021-06-11 08:35:58,Child,Yay.
93,00:11:08,2021-06-11 08:36:00,Parent,And they lived happily ever after. What material would you choose to build a house?
94,00:11:15,2021-06-11 08:36:07,Child,Brick.
95,00:11:17,2021-06-11 08:36:09,Parent,Brick? You would take the time?
96,00:11:19,2021-06-11 08:36:11,Child,Yeah.
97,00:11:20,2021-06-11 08:36:12,Parent,"Wha, what would you do if the wolf was climbing down your chimney?"
98,00:11:28,2021-06-11 08:36:20,Child,"Uh, I would light a fire."
99,00:11:30,2021-06-11 08:36:22,Parent,You would light a fire?
100,00:11:30,2021-06-11 08:36:22,Child,And put a boiling pot.
101,00:11:30,2021-06-11 08:36:22,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
102,00:11:30,2021-06-11 08:36:22,Child,And cook the wolf.
103,00:11:34,2021-06-11 08:36:26,Parent,You would eat the wolf?
104,00:11:35,2021-06-11 08:36:27,Child,Yeah.
105,00:11:35,2021-06-11 08:36:27,Parent,"I don't know. All right, let's pick one more. You want another short story or long story? Short? Long? [crosstalk 00:11:51]"
106,00:11:53,2021-06-11 08:36:45,Child,You could've just gone back to bookshelf.
107,00:11:55,2021-06-11 08:36:47,Parent,"I think I just pressed the button too many, too, okay. Do you wanna try one of the, uh... Which one you wanna... You wanna try that one? Wait, wait, there's more books. Please stop that. Do you want to try one of these spring, summer, or fall ones that we haven't read yet?"
108,00:12:14,2021-06-11 08:37:06,Child,No.
109,00:12:18,2021-06-11 08:37:10,Parent,"How about fall? Or sp... How about, or summer? We're going into summer? [crosstalk 00:12:20] This one again?"
110,00:12:18,2021-06-11 08:37:10,Child,Yeah.
111,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Parent,Okay. The Three Little Pigs.
112,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Child,(laughs)
113,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Parent,Should we ask Jibo if he likes The Three Little Pigs?
114,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Child,Hey Jibo.
115,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Robot,Yes.
116,00:12:19,2021-06-11 08:37:11,Child,Do you like The Three Little Pigs?
117,00:12:47,2021-06-11 08:37:39,Robot,Yeah.
118,00:12:51,2021-06-11 08:37:43,Parent,"Once upon a time an old sow sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write"" she said, ""and remember that I love you."" Oh, how does momma feel?"
119,00:13:03,2021-06-11 08:37:55,Child,Sad.
120,00:13:04,2021-06-11 08:37:56,Parent,"Sad. The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea"" said the man. ""Mind your own business, thank you"" said the little pig. And he bought the straw and set about building a house. It took him now time at all. Very soon, a lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig, pig was just about his favorite food in the world, so he knocked on the door and said ""Little pig, little pig, let me in, come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end and he said ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the house in and he gobbled up the little pig. You need to sneeze?"
121,00:13:04,2021-06-11 08:37:56,Child,Yeah.
122,00:14:01,2021-06-11 08:38:53,Parent,"The second little big met a man with a load of sticks. ""I've got it"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that"" said the man. Bless you. Remember to cough or sneeze in your cuff pocket."
123,00:14:14,2021-06-11 08:39:06,Child,Yeah.
124,00:14:15,2021-06-11 08:39:07,Parent,"""Oh, poo"" said the little pig. ""What would you know?"" And he bought the sticks and went to work building the house. ""Very pretty"" he said. I still think this picture is funny because there's a big chubby pig and he's like [inaudible 00:14:28]"
125,00:14:28,2021-06-11 08:39:20,Child,(laughs) [crosstalk 00:14:33]
126,00:14:33,2021-06-11 08:39:25,Parent,"He is pushed in there. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house than the wolf happened by. He was still hungry and he said ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" The wolf didn't care for all that, that at all. And he said ""I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha, ha, ha"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the house in and gobbled up the little pig."
127,00:14:33,2021-06-11 08:39:25,Child,(laughs)
128,00:15:09,2021-06-11 08:40:01,Parent,"Now the third pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine sturdy house"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow"" said the little pig. So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in than he noticed the wolf loitering about. And the wolf, who was still hungry said ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" Well, the wolf had heard that before and he said ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach"" muttered the wolf. And he put on his most dazzling smile. What do you think dazzling means?"
129,00:16:09,2021-06-11 08:41:01,Child,Sneaky.
130,00:16:12,2021-06-11 08:41:04,Parent,"Like sneaky and, and, and biggest smile to get the wolf to think he was nice."
131,00:16:18,2021-06-11 08:41:10,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
132,00:16:18,2021-06-11 08:41:10,Parent,"""Little pig, I was only teasing"" he said. ""By the way, I hear that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I have too much to do now"" said the little pig. ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent"" said the wolf. ""I'll come for you at 6."" The next morning, the little big got up at 5, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basketful of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at 6, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done"" he said. ""By the way, there's a lovely apple tree down in Merry Meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must... You gonna sneeze? ""I must cook my turnips"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid"" said the wolf. ""Shall we say at 5?"""
133,00:17:07,2021-06-11 08:41:59,Child,(laughs) Now he'll get up at 4.
134,00:17:12,2021-06-11 08:42:04,Parent,The next morning the little pig was at...
135,00:17:15,2021-06-11 08:42:07,Child,4. (laughs)
136,00:17:17,2021-06-11 08:42:09,Parent,"...and went off for the apples. It took longer than he expected to reach Merry Meadow. And while he was gathering applies in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home. This little pig is kind of sneaky too, huh?"
137,00:17:17,2021-06-11 08:42:09,Child,Yeah.
138,00:17:41,2021-06-11 08:42:33,Parent,"The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. What... ""Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there?"" said the little pig. ""Would 3 o'clock suit you?"" ""Colossal"" said the wolf. ""Three it is."" Just to make sure he would be there at..."
139,00:17:58,2021-06-11 08:42:50,Child,Two.
140,00:17:58,2021-06-11 08:42:50,Parent,"...2, at 1 in the afternoon, the little pig went to the fair and had a fine time. So fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill."
141,00:18:17,2021-06-11 08:43:09,Child,Kissing station.
142,00:18:19,2021-06-11 08:43:11,Parent,(laughs) kissing station. Would you stand at a kissing station? And let people kiss your feet? No? What if it was me giving the kisses?
143,00:18:19,2021-06-11 08:43:11,Child,No.
144,00:18:19,2021-06-11 08:43:11,Parent,Would you come get kisses?
145,00:18:21,2021-06-11 08:43:13,Child,"No, that would be [crosstalk 00:18:23]. [inaudible 00:18:23]"
146,00:18:23,2021-06-11 08:43:15,Parent,"(laughs) Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared he ran all the way home. That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened? And you didn't die?"" said the little pig? ""That great round thing was a butter churn and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed into the roof, onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire. ""Here I come"" cried the wolf. ""Dinnertime."" He looks like he's humping into a pool, huh?"
147,00:19:22,2021-06-11 08:44:14,Child,Yeah.
148,00:19:22,2021-06-11 08:44:14,Parent,"""You can say that again"" said the little pig. And he cooks the mean old wolf and gobbled him up."
149,00:19:26,2021-06-11 08:44:18,Child,"""Dinnertime."""
150,00:19:26,2021-06-11 08:44:18,Parent,The end.
151,00:19:30,2021-06-11 08:44:22,Child,You can say that again. You can say that twice.
152,00:19:40,2021-06-11 08:44:32,Parent,"(laughter) Well, we just read this one, so we're not gonna read it again. So we can pick one more short one, let's pick a short one. A short one and then we'll be done."
153,00:19:48,2021-06-11 08:44:40,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
154,00:19:53,2021-06-11 08:44:45,Parent,We can keep reading if you want.
155,00:19:55,2021-06-11 08:44:47,Robot,I had so much fun. [crosstalk 00:19:57] I will now stop recording.
