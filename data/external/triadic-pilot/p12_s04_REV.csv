1,00:00:03,2021-06-08 16:34:15,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on, and start audio and video recording."
2,00:00:10,2021-06-08 16:34:22,Parent,Okay.
3,00:00:10,2021-06-08 16:34:22,Robot,"Let's get stated. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:24,2021-06-08 16:34:36,Parent,"All right, let's go. Geraldine, the Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people. The slamming of doors. The barking of dogs. The rushing of water. And meows of cats in the courtyard. And, of course, the soft peeping of mice. But music, never. Then, one morning, in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous case of Parmesan cheese. The largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how could she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends, who lived next door, and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said. And off they went. ""It's enormous."" ""It's gigantic."" ""It's immense."" ""It's fantastic."" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed, and pulled, and tugged, and finally, they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden, of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed, until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious. Until they seemed to move lightly through the air, like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music,"" she thought. ""This must be music."" She listened all through the night, until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window panes. But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer, until it stopped altogether. ""Wait, wait,"" Geraldine begged. ""Play some more."" But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk, and lasted until the break of day. And so, night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight, they lingered in her ears. Then one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food. And there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""But that is not possibly,"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" asked the others, angrily. ""Because... Because... Because it music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine in surprise. ""What is music?"" they asked all together. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. Then, a long, soft, beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" [inaudible 00:06:22]. ""No,"" said Geraldine, joyfully. ""Now we can eat the cheese, because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content. Do you have any questions, or... Are you fine?"
5,00:06:54,2021-06-08 16:41:06,Child,Yeah.
6,00:06:54,2021-06-08 16:41:06,Parent,Okay. Don't you find Jibo really quiet? You don't want to talk to him?
7,00:07:11,2021-06-08 16:41:23,Child,That's all right.
8,00:07:12,2021-06-08 16:41:24,Parent,"There's Three Little Pigs. There's two different Three Little Pigs. Yeah, you want this? The Year at Maple Hill Farm? Fall?"
9,00:07:20,2021-06-08 16:41:32,Child,No.
10,00:07:32,2021-06-08 16:41:44,Parent,"Once upon a time, Three Little Pigs. Illustrated by Thea Kilros. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day, mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now. It is time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong, and you will be safe from the big, bad wolf."" The first little pig was a lazy little pig. He built the simplest kind of house, so he could have the time to rest. His house was made of-"
11,00:08:13,2021-06-08 16:42:25,Child,Of... Of soap.
12,00:08:26,2021-06-08 16:42:38,Parent,Why don't you ask Jibo?
13,00:08:26,2021-06-08 16:42:38,Child,"Oh yes, but I know the book."
14,00:08:26,2021-06-08 16:42:38,Parent,Straw.
15,00:08:26,2021-06-08 16:42:38,Child,"Straw. Oh, I read... I read it."
16,00:08:39,2021-06-08 16:42:51,Parent,"You read it? It was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful little pig. He built his house quickly, so he could go out and play. His house was made of-"
17,00:08:57,2021-06-08 16:43:09,Child,Wood.
18,00:08:59,2021-06-08 16:43:11,Parent,Here's the more-
19,00:08:59,2021-06-08 16:43:11,Child,Twigs.
20,00:08:59,2021-06-08 16:43:11,Parent,Sticks.
21,00:08:59,2021-06-08 16:43:11,Child,Sticks.
22,00:09:11,2021-06-08 16:43:23,Parent,It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of-
23,00:09:23,2021-06-08 16:43:35,Child,Brick.
24,00:09:26,2021-06-08 16:43:38,Parent,"The little pigs didn't know what lurking... They didn't know that, lurking in the nearby forest was the big, bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry, and for his supper he wanted a pig. The big, bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" replied the first little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in,"" growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. Next, the wolf walk... Knocked on the second little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brother standing on the other side. ""The big, bad wolf blew our houses down,"" they cried. ""Come, come inside,"" said their brother. Minutes later, there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" ""Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"" said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed, and he huffed. But no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down. Can you sit up straight? Watch your... Sit up straight. The big, bad wolf was very angry. ""I'll get you, little piggies,"" he snarled. He climbed up on the roof, and crept toward the chimney. Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with hot, crackling flames. The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house, into the woods, howling. The big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again. And they lived happily ever after. You don't have questions for Jibo? You don't want to talk to him? What you thought about it? Anything? No, no? Okay. Do you want Jibo to help you pick a book? No? You just don't want to talk to Jibo today?"
25,00:09:26,2021-06-08 16:43:38,Child,I just don't know how to say it.
26,00:12:32,2021-06-08 16:46:44,Parent,Okay.
27,00:12:32,2021-06-08 16:46:44,Child,He was telling no questions.
28,00:12:34,2021-06-08 16:46:46,Parent,"Well, I told you he doesn't ask questions today."
29,00:12:37,2021-06-08 16:46:49,Child,I understand.
30,00:12:38,2021-06-08 16:46:50,Parent,"So if you want to talk to him, you have to do it first. You want a short story? Okay. The Three Billy Goats Gruff. Once upon a time, there were three billy goats gruff. There was a little... Little billy goat gruff, a middle-sized billy goat gruff, and a big billy goat gruff. The three billy goats gruff lived in a field, and they spent their days munching the green grass. On one side of the field, there was a stream. And over the stream, there was a rickety bridge. Where is the rickety bridge? On the other side of the rickety bridge, there was a hill, and there was the grass. And there, the grass grew greener and sweeter than it did in the field of the billy goats gruff. Under the rickety bridge lived a big, hairy troll in a deep, dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge, and that made the troll furious. He was also hungry. One day, the little billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass up the hill, on the other side of the stream, looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow big and fat."" So trip-trap, trip-trap went the hooves of the little billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. What are hooves?"
31,00:14:27,2021-06-08 16:48:39,Child,That means... Hooves mean [inaudible 00:14:33].
32,00:14:33,2021-06-08 16:48:45,Parent,Hooves are his legs. Those are hooves.
33,00:14:41,2021-06-08 16:48:53,Child,"Well, yeah. His hooves."
34,00:14:44,2021-06-08 16:48:56,Parent,"Yeah? The big, hairy troll woke up with a start. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" he roared. ""I am,"" said the little billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no, you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat, and goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little billy goat gruff. ""I'm only small. I wouldn't make much for a mouthful. Wait for my brother. He's much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge, to the other side. Just then, the middle-size billy goat gruff looked up, and he, too, saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip-trap, trip-trap went the hooves of the middle-size billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am,"" said the middle-size billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" Sit up. ""Oh no, you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner, I need to eat. And goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the middle-size billy goat gruff. ""I'm not very big. I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. He's much, much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the big... Big billy goat gruff looked up, and he, too, saw that the grass on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then, I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So trip-trap, trip-trap went the hooves of the big billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am,"" said the big billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no, you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from a deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat, and goat's a treat. So I'll have you for my dinner."" The big billy goat gruff stopped. His knees shook. His hooves trembled. Clickety-clack. Clickety-clack on the rickety bridge. Then he pulled himself together. ""I don't think you will,"" he said. And he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. Then the big billy goat gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brothers on the other side of the hill. As for the big, hairy troll, I am happy to say that he was never seen again."
35,00:18:33,2021-06-08 16:52:45,Child,Is it... Are we done?
36,00:18:39,2021-06-08 16:52:51,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Ask Jibo. Can you... Can you say it? No, you have to talk to Jibo."
37,00:18:42,2021-06-08 16:52:54,Child,"Hey, Jibo. Hey, Jibo."
38,00:18:52,2021-06-08 16:53:04,Robot,Yes.

40,00:18:55,2021-06-08 16:53:07,Robot,Yes. That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop-
