And then one morning in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lives, she discovered an enormous piece of parmesan cheese, the largest she had ever seen.

The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden of solid cheese. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse [inaudible 00:09:21]. Astonished, exhausted and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awaken by some strange sounds.

You must share your cheese with us."" ""But that's not possible."" Next page please. Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others angrily. ""Because, because it is music.""
