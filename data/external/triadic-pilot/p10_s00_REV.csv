I will not be responding to ""Hey Jibo"", and I will not turn blue, but we can still chat. Because today is our first session, I would first like to learn how you guys read books without me. Today, I will just be listening here. Let's get started. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app. Check any books you like."
1,00:01:01,2021-06-06 18:34:12,Parent,Do you want one about farm animals or on the farm? You like that one?
2,00:01:10,2021-06-06 18:34:21,Child,"Yeah. Yeah, I seen that one before I think."

6,00:01:24,2021-06-06 18:34:35,Child,"Oh, oh, I have."
7,00:01:32,2021-06-06 18:34:43,Parent,"A told B, and B told C, I'll meet you at the top of the coconut tree."
8,00:01:58,2021-06-06 18:35:09,Robot,Touch the bottom right corner to flip pages.
9,00:02:04,2021-06-06 18:35:15,Parent,"Thank you, Jibo. Whee! Said D to E-F-G. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree. Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Here comes H up the coconut tree. And I and J, and tag-along K all on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka chicka boom boom! Will there be enough room? Look who's coming. L-M-N-O-P. And Q-R-S and T-U-V. Still more. W and X, Y, and Z. A whole alphabet up the... Oh, no! Chicka chicka boom boom! Skit scat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Everybody's running to the coconut tree. Mamas and papas and uncles and aunts hug their little dears and then dust their pants. ""Help us up!"" cried A-B-C. Next from the pileup, skinned-knee D and stubbed-toe E and patched-up F. Then comes G, all out of breath."
10,00:03:54,2021-06-06 18:37:05,Child,G's all out of breath?
11,00:03:54,2021-06-06 18:37:05,Parent,Apparently.
12,00:03:59,2021-06-06 18:37:10,Child,No [inaudible 00:03:59]. We should get him to a doctor.
13,00:04:04,2021-06-06 18:37:15,Parent,(laughs) He should. He should go to a doctor if he can't breathe. That's good.
14,00:04:06,2021-06-06 18:37:17,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative)-
15,00:04:09,2021-06-06 18:37:20,Parent,H is tangled up with I. J and K are about to cry.
16,00:04:14,2021-06-06 18:37:25,Child,"And look, and it looks like a bow-tie."
17,00:04:19,2021-06-06 18:37:30,Parent,"(laughs) It does look like a bow-tie. L is knotted like a tie. Hey, there you go. M is looped. N is stooped. O is twisted the alley-oop. Skip skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Look who's coming. It's black-eyed P. Q-R-S and loose-tooth T."
18,00:04:55,2021-06-06 18:38:06,Child,"What, like T has a loose tooth. Which is gold."
19,00:04:59,2021-06-06 18:38:10,Parent,"Oh, look at that. He does have a loose tooth, doesn't he?"
20,00:05:00,2021-06-06 18:38:11,Child,"Uh, and it's orange."
21,00:05:04,2021-06-06 18:38:15,Parent,"That's, that's kind of weird, huh?"
22,00:05:06,2021-06-06 18:38:17,Child,Yeah.
23,00:05:11,2021-06-06 18:38:22,Parent,"Then U-V-W wiggle-jiggle free. Last to come, X-Y-Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree. But, chicka chicka boom boom! Look, there's a full moon."
24,00:05:11,2021-06-06 18:38:22,Child,"That's not the moon. That's the sun, I think."
25,00:05:32,2021-06-06 18:38:43,Parent,"Oh, you think that's the sun?"
26,00:05:56,2021-06-06 18:39:07,Child,"Yeah, I think that's the sun."
27,00:05:56,2021-06-06 18:39:07,Parent,Okay.
28,00:05:56,2021-06-06 18:39:07,Child,And you know what? Maybe it's Summer time in Hawaii.
29,00:05:56,2021-06-06 18:39:07,Parent,"That may be, yes."
30,00:05:58,2021-06-06 18:39:09,Child,Just... (laughs) Looking at [inaudible 00:05:58].

32,00:05:58,2021-06-06 18:39:09,Parent,Do you want to do the page turning?

36,00:06:01,2021-06-06 18:39:12,Parent,"Okay. A is out of bed, and this is what he said: ""Dare double dare, you can't catch me. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree."" Chicka chicka boom boom! The End."
37,00:06:18,2021-06-06 18:39:29,Child,That's enough.
38,00:06:19,2021-06-06 18:39:30,Parent,Tap there.

Want to do the farm animal one? Okay, you got to pick one. No, we already did that one. Pick one of the other ones. Could be On the Farm? Sit up. On the Farm."
47,00:06:47,2021-06-06 18:39:58,Child,"I didn't even finish my, my meal."
48,00:07:29,2021-06-06 18:40:40,Parent,"I know, but it won't go-"
49,00:07:29,2021-06-06 18:40:40,Child,It's probably getting cold by now.
50,00:07:33,2021-06-06 18:40:44,Parent,"We should do... Dude, we could heat it up. Okay? Okay? I can't bring food down here and play in front of Jibo, okay."

52,00:07:44,2021-06-06 18:40:55,Parent,"We, we'll do this with Jibo, then you can, then you can finish your pizza. I'll make sure it's warm enough. Okay? Okay? On the Farm. David Elliott, illustrated by Holly Meade. [inaudible 00:08:01]. The rooster crows and struts. He's got feathers. He's got guts. Oh, the rooster struts and crows. What's he thinking? No one knows.

53,00:08:28,2021-06-06 18:41:39,Child,"Cows are amazing. They make, they make milk."
54,00:08:28,2021-06-06 18:41:39,Parent,They do make milk.
55,00:08:28,2021-06-06 18:41:39,Child,"Milk, and I wonder how they do."
56,00:08:29,2021-06-06 18:41:40,Parent,I don't know. How do you think they make milk?
57,00:08:30,2021-06-06 18:41:41,Child,"I think they eat, and, and when they poo it makes milk."
58,00:08:45,2021-06-06 18:41:56,Parent,"(laughs) I don't know that, I don't know that it exactly works that way."
59,00:08:46,2021-06-06 18:41:57,Child,That milk is cow poo.
60,00:08:50,2021-06-06 18:42:01,Parent,"No. I, uh, that, that's not true. (laughs)"
61,00:08:53,2021-06-06 18:42:04,Child,(laughs)
62,00:08:54,2021-06-06 18:42:05,Parent,"It does come out of a cow, though. Go ahead. Hit the... The pony whinnies in the wind, kicks in his stall. He's as mighty as his cousin, just not as tall."

64,00:09:08,2021-06-06 18:42:19,Parent,"No, he's definitely, he's definitely not as tall as the other horse."
65,00:09:17,2021-06-06 18:42:28,Child,"Yeah, well it's his cousin, I think."
66,00:09:19,2021-06-06 18:42:30,Parent,Do you want to touch screen? The dog sleeps with one eye open in the shady farm house yard. You might think he's keeping cool. Beware! He's keeping guard.
67,00:09:37,2021-06-06 18:42:48,Child,Oo. We should beware.
68,00:09:39,2021-06-06 18:42:50,Parent,We should beware. The sheep began his wooly life as gentle as a lamb. Too bad he's turned into a ram. Bam!
69,00:09:51,2021-06-06 18:43:02,Child,What's a ram?
70,00:09:53,2021-06-06 18:43:04,Parent,"A ram is an adult, male sheep."
71,00:10:04,2021-06-06 18:43:15,Child,Oh.
72,00:10:04,2021-06-06 18:43:15,Parent,And they tend to butt heads like that.

74,00:10:04,2021-06-06 18:43:15,Parent,The barn cat. Mice had better think twice.
75,00:10:10,2021-06-06 18:43:21,Child,"Yeah, they better think twice. Or hww. Or the cat goes..."
76,00:10:17,2021-06-06 18:43:28,Parent,"Is that what the cat's going to do? (laughs) Is the cat going to, going to, going to chew on the... enjoy the mice?"
77,00:10:17,2021-06-06 18:43:28,Child,"The, that, that's what a cat... That, and those, that's what they've found cat's eat."
78,00:10:17,2021-06-06 18:43:28,Parent,(laughs)
79,00:10:17,2021-06-06 18:43:28,Child,It's true.
80,00:10:22,2021-06-06 18:43:33,Parent,"Do you want to, you want to step forward? The goat. He eats everything from trash to trillium. Hey! Look out. He'll knock you silly. When he's bad, we call him William. When he's good, he's just our Billy."
81,00:10:56,2021-06-06 18:44:07,Child,"Bill, Bill, Billy goat?"
82,00:10:57,2021-06-06 18:44:08,Parent,"Like Billy goat, from the story."
83,00:10:59,2021-06-06 18:44:10,Child,"(laughs) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Like Billy goat. Sometimes he was not in the story, and sometimes he was nice in the story."
84,00:10:59,2021-06-06 18:44:10,Parent,Like to...
85,00:11:17,2021-06-06 18:44:28,Child,"I'm sad though, it's just all about Hugo and Billy goat."
86,00:11:21,2021-06-06 18:44:32,Parent,It would be nice if we had another story like that.
87,00:11:24,2021-06-06 18:44:35,Child,"Yeah, yeah. There is no one. There is no one."
88,00:11:27,2021-06-06 18:44:38,Parent,"The pig. Her tail, as coy as a ringlet. In her eye there's a delicate sheen. Some look at her and see a sow. I see a beauty queen."
89,00:11:27,2021-06-06 18:44:38,Child,There's like a little human in the background.
90,00:11:27,2021-06-06 18:44:38,Parent,What's in the background?
91,00:11:47,2021-06-06 18:44:58,Child,A human.
92,00:11:48,2021-06-06 18:44:59,Parent,"Oh, there is a human in the background. You sure that's not a pig?"
93,00:11:48,2021-06-06 18:44:59,Child,(laughs) Yes. Dad.
94,00:11:49,2021-06-06 18:45:00,Parent,"Okay, touch the tablet. The snake coils in the garden like a spring or the wild, and winding melody he hears but cannot sing."
95,00:12:09,2021-06-06 18:45:20,Child,"Uh, uh, uh-oh."
96,00:12:17,2021-06-06 18:45:28,Parent,"The bees tell their story sweet and old. It begins in clover, it ends with gold. The bull knows what he likes, cows and corn. Knows what he is, muscle and horn."
97,00:12:35,2021-06-06 18:45:46,Child,Is that...
98,00:12:42,2021-06-06 18:45:53,Parent,"The turtle lifts her fossil head and blinks. One, two, three. Time to leave awful light. I her house, it's always night."
99,00:12:51,2021-06-06 18:46:02,Child,"Look. There's a human in, there's another human in the background. See? A human in the background."
100,00:13:01,2021-06-06 18:46:12,Parent,I see that. What's a person doing?
101,00:13:05,2021-06-06 18:46:16,Child,"She, she's watching the, she's watching the... She's watching the turtles."
102,00:13:20,2021-06-06 18:46:31,Parent,"I think. The duck quacks, the hen squawks, the goose honks."
103,00:13:27,2021-06-06 18:46:38,Child,Honk! (laughs)
104,00:13:33,2021-06-06 18:46:44,Parent,But the rabbit listens. Listens and listens.
105,00:13:36,2021-06-06 18:46:47,Child,The [inaudible 00:13:42].
106,00:13:43,2021-06-06 18:46:54,Parent,And it doesn't make a sound.
107,00:13:44,2021-06-06 18:46:55,Child,Now can we be done?
108,00:13:54,2021-06-06 18:47:05,Parent,Just [inaudible 00:13:55].
109,00:13:55,2021-06-06 18:47:06,Robot,"That was a great story. That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording, to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey with your child together. Thank you. By-"
