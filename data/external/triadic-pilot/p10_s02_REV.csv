302,00:26:35,2021-06-10 19:31:02,Parent,"Wait, no, we didn't do that page."
303,00:26:41,2021-06-10 19:31:08,Child,"What? Oh, I'm just-"
304,00:26:41,2021-06-10 19:31:08,Parent,Let-
305,00:26:41,2021-06-10 19:31:08,Child,... so hungry.
306,00:26:43,2021-06-10 19:31:10,Parent,"I know. You'll, you'll survive. ""People listened each day for his toe-tapping clatter. Rap a tap tap, think of that."" All right, come on. ""He danced many rhythms that were seldom the same. Rap a tap tap, think of that."" Look at all the people there playing, playing the drums."
307,00:27:04,2021-06-10 19:31:31,Child,"Eh, we..."
308,00:27:09,2021-06-10 19:31:36,Parent,"""Dance was his passion, and it brought him fame."" Oh, good for him. ""Rap a tap tap, think of that."""
309,00:27:18,2021-06-10 19:31:45,Child,"I'm thinking of that, I'm thinking of that being me. (laughs)."
310,00:27:20,2021-06-10 19:31:47,Parent,"Oh, you want to be the tap-dancing guy that gets famous?"
311,00:27:23,2021-06-10 19:31:50,Child,"Yes. I wanna be famous, okay?"
312,00:27:26,2021-06-10 19:31:53,Parent,"Yes. Well, you had dance earlier today."
313,00:27:30,2021-06-10 19:31:57,Child,"I, did I get, I, did I get famous?"
314,00:27:30,2021-06-10 19:31:57,Parent,Not yet.
315,00:27:33,2021-06-10 19:32:00,Child,(laughs). I want-
316,00:27:33,2021-06-10 19:32:00,Parent,That-
317,00:27:33,2021-06-10 19:32:00,Child,I like-
318,00:27:36,2021-06-10 19:32:03,Parent,"You're, you're young. There's still time."
319,00:27:38,2021-06-10 19:32:05,Child,"How would I get... how would I get famous when, uh, just for our little recital?"
320,00:27:45,2021-06-10 19:32:12,Parent,"Actually, you're probably not going to get famous from this recital. That's, that's probably true."
321,00:27:50,2021-06-10 19:32:17,Child,"And, by the way, this wasn't a little recital. It was just practice."
322,00:27:58,2021-06-10 19:32:25,Parent,"Oh, okay. ""Bojangles, Bojangles, that was his name. Rap a tap tap, think of that."""
323,00:27:58,2021-06-10 19:32:25,Child,"I'm thinking of that being me, again. Now can we be done?"
324,00:27:58,2021-06-10 19:32:25,Robot,Do you know who Bojangles is?
325,00:27:58,2021-06-10 19:32:25,Child,No. He-
326,00:28:15,2021-06-10 19:32:42,Robot,Bill Robinson.
327,00:28:17,2021-06-10 19:32:44,Child,Oh. (laughs).
328,00:28:20,2021-06-10 19:32:47,Parent,I don't know it. I don't know Bojangles either.
329,00:28:24,2021-06-10 19:32:51,Child,"I would go, I-"
330,00:28:24,2021-06-10 19:32:51,Parent,"We'll take... When we're done with story time, we should ask Jibo who Mr. Bojangles is."
331,00:28:28,2021-06-10 19:32:55,Child,Who's Mr. Bojangles?
332,00:28:35,2021-06-10 19:33:02,Parent,After we're done with story time. (laughing).
333,00:28:37,2021-06-10 19:33:04,Child,"Uh, uh-"
334,00:28:37,2021-06-10 19:33:04,Robot,That was a great story.
335,00:28:38,2021-06-10 19:33:05,Child,"But it's done, let's be [crosstalk 00:28:39]."
336,00:28:38,2021-06-10 19:33:05,Parent,Shh.
337,00:28:38,2021-06-10 19:33:05,Child,Well-
338,00:28:41,2021-06-10 19:33:08,Robot,"That's it for today's session. I had so much fun. I will now stop recording, to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey with your child together. Thank you. Bye-bye."
