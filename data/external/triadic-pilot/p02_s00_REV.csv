16,00:01:33,2021-04-25 09:59:29,Parent,"I think- I think- I think that navigation brings back to the first page. Wait, what did it say?"

27,00:02:25,2021-04-25 10:00:21,Child,Closing your eyes.
28,00:02:31,2021-04-25 10:00:27,Parent,Opposite of seeing is closing your eyes? Yep. Sounds pretty true. I can hear. I hear with my...
29,00:02:40,2021-04-25 10:00:36,Child,Ear.

36,00:03:08,2021-04-25 10:01:04,Parent,"Yeah. Actually this one says fingers, but yeah. You touch with all of your skin, right? I do all this with my senses. I have five senses. When I see the sun or a frog... Next page. Or my baby sister, I use my sense of sight. I am seeing. When I hear a drum or a fire engine or a bird, I use my sense of..."

38,00:03:37,2021-04-25 10:01:33,Parent,"Your sense of ears? Your sense of hearing. I am hearing. When I smell soap or a pine tree or cookies just out of the oven, I use my sense of..."
39,00:03:56,2021-04-25 10:01:52,Child,Your nose.
40,00:03:57,2021-04-25 10:01:53,Parent,"Yeah, you're using your nose to do what?"

46,00:04:18,2021-04-25 10:02:14,Parent,"And taste buds, yeah. When I touch a kitten or a balloon or water, I use my sense of... Touch."
47,00:04:26,2021-04-25 10:02:22,Child,Touch.
48,00:04:32,2021-04-25 10:02:28,Parent,I am touching.
49,00:04:41,2021-04-25 10:02:37,Parent,(silence)
50,00:04:41,2021-04-25 10:02:37,Parent,"(laughs) Let me try. Hm. Here, that's the end? I don't know. Did we do all the senses? Nope, there we go. Sometimes I use all my senses at once. Sometimes I use only one. I often play a game with myself and guess how many senses I am using at that time. When I look at the moon and the stars, I use one sense, I am seeing. Um, when I laugh and play with my puppy, I use four senses. What senses do you think they use when they play with their puppy? What senses do you use when you play with your puppy? Do you taste her?"
51,00:05:37,2021-04-25 10:03:33,Child,No.
52,00:05:37,2021-04-25 10:03:33,Parent,"No, (laughs) you don't taste your puppy."
53,00:05:39,2021-04-25 10:03:35,Child,Your hands?
54,00:05:42,2021-04-25 10:03:38,Parent,"Your hands, yeah, for touch."
55,00:05:43,2021-04-25 10:03:39,Child,Eyes?
56,00:05:47,2021-04-25 10:03:43,Parent,Yeah. To- seeing.
57,00:05:47,2021-04-25 10:03:43,Parent,(silence)
58,00:06:00,2021-04-25 10:03:56,Parent,"Taste? Oh, I see. Your- you..."
59,00:06:08,2021-04-25 10:04:04,Child,Smelling.
60,00:06:09,2021-04-25 10:04:05,Parent,"You smell Stella, you can definitely smell Stella. So and-"
61,00:06:18,2021-04-25 10:04:14,Speaker 5,Another.
62,00:06:19,2021-04-25 10:04:15,Parent,"Well, she said see already. So the other one is... So... You have a marker."
63,00:06:26,2021-04-25 10:04:22,Speaker 5,Touch.
64,00:06:28,2021-04-25 10:04:24,Parent,"Touch. Yeah, she said touch already."
65,00:06:29,2021-04-25 10:04:25,Child,Ears.
66,00:06:33,2021-04-25 10:04:29,Parent,"Yeah. Although Stella doesn't make much sound. Yeah. When I can play with my puppy, I use four senses. I see, hear, smell and touch. When I bounce a ball, I use three senses."
67,00:06:49,2021-04-25 10:04:45,Child,Hands.
68,00:06:49,2021-04-25 10:04:45,Parent,Yeah.
69,00:06:49,2021-04-25 10:04:45,Child,Eyes. And feet?
70,00:06:53,2021-04-25 10:04:49,Parent,Feet? Yeah you use your feet but what's a sense that you would use? So...
71,00:07:01,2021-04-25 10:04:57,Child,"Feet, eyes."
72,00:07:03,2021-04-25 10:04:59,Parent,Yeah. How else maybe? What else might you be sensing? Does the ball make a sound when it bounces?
73,00:07:14,2021-04-25 10:05:10,Child,Hearing.
74,00:07:15,2021-04-25 10:05:11,Parent,Yeah.
75,00:07:18,2021-04-25 10:05:14,Child,Can you give me that?
76,00:07:20,2021-04-25 10:05:16,Parent,Sometimes we use more of one sense and less of another. But each sense is very important to me because it makes me aware. To be aware is to see all there is to see. Hear all there is to hear. Smell all there is to smell. Taste all there is to taste. And touch all there is to touch.
77,00:07:47,2021-04-25 10:05:43,Parent,(silence)
78,00:08:00,2021-04-25 10:05:56,Child,[inaudible 00:08:00]
79,00:08:02,2021-04-25 10:05:58,Parent,"You have the opposite of opposite? Wherever I go, whatever I do, every minute of the day, my senses are working. They make me aware. The end."
