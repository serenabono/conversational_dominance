0,00:00:06,2021-06-16 16:35:23,Robot,Hello.
1,00:00:09,2021-06-16 16:35:26,Child,Hello.
2,00:00:10,2021-06-16 16:35:27,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading storybooks together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
3,00:00:43,2021-06-16 16:36:00,Parent,"(laughs). Okay, The Three Little Pigs. Once upon a time, an old soul sent her three little pigs out into the world to seek their fortune. ""Now be sure to write,"" she said, ""And remember that I love you."""
4,00:01:00,2021-06-16 16:36:17,Parent,"The first little pig met a man with a load of straw. ""I know,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy your straw and build a house."" ""That's not a good idea,"" said the man. ""Mind your own business, thank you,"" said the little pig, and he brought the straw and set about building a house. It took him no time at all."
5,00:01:23,2021-06-16 16:36:40,Robot,"Why did the little pig say to the man, ""Mind your own business""?"
6,00:01:32,2021-06-16 16:36:49,Parent,Talk to Jibo.
7,00:01:32,2021-06-16 16:36:49,Child,"Because, because he, he didn't mind... It was... It didn't matter to him."
8,00:01:44,2021-06-16 16:37:01,Robot,Does the little pig want to take the man's idea for help?
9,00:01:49,2021-06-16 16:37:06,Child,Yes.
10,00:01:49,2021-06-16 16:37:06,Parent,Are you sure?
11,00:01:50,2021-06-16 16:37:07,Child,No.
12,00:01:50,2021-06-16 16:37:07,Parent,(laughs) Can you sit up straight?
13,00:01:55,2021-06-16 16:37:12,Robot,Why?
14,00:01:57,2021-06-16 16:37:14,Parent,"Why doesn't he want the man's help? [Foreign language 00:02:00], sit up straight."
15,00:02:06,2021-06-16 16:37:23,Child,'Cause he knows how to do a house. And he's really fast.
16,00:02:11,2021-06-16 16:37:28,Robot,"So many that is why he said, ""Mind your own business."""
17,00:02:22,2021-06-16 16:37:39,Parent,"Very soon, the lean and hungry wolf happened by. Pig was just about his favorite food in the world. So he knocked on the door and said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" This annoyed the wolf to no end, and he said, ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Go right ahead,"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed, and he puffed, and he blew the house in. And he gobbled up the little pig."
18,00:02:57,2021-06-16 16:38:14,Parent,"The second little pig met the man with a load of sticks. ""I got it,"" said the little pig. ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" ""I'd think twice about that,"" said the man. ""Oh-"""
19,00:03:10,2021-06-16 16:38:27,Robot,"Jenny, maybe you can ask [Alexandre 00:03:12] a question about second little pig."
20,00:03:16,2021-06-16 16:38:33,Parent,"Okay, um, the second little pig says, um, ""I'll buy those sticks and build a house."" But the guy said, ""I'd think twice about that."" Why did he say that?"
21,00:03:29,2021-06-16 16:38:46,Child,"Because, um, that's not so, that's not so good for a house."
22,00:03:37,2021-06-16 16:38:54,Parent,Not so sturdy and strong?
23,00:03:43,2021-06-16 16:39:00,Child,No. You have to always do it in a brick or in wood.
24,00:03:43,2021-06-16 16:39:00,Parent,"Oh, really? But sticks are wood too."
25,00:03:45,2021-06-16 16:39:02,Child,"Yes, but-"
26,00:03:48,2021-06-16 16:39:05,Parent,But they're too thin?
27,00:03:49,2021-06-16 16:39:06,Child,Yeah.
28,00:03:50,2021-06-16 16:39:07,Parent,"Yes, okay."
29,00:03:50,2021-06-16 16:39:07,Child,You need a big wood.
30,00:03:52,2021-06-16 16:39:09,Parent,"""Oh, poo,"" said the little pig, ""What would you know?"" And he brought the sticks and went to work building a house. ""Very tricky,"" he said. No sooner had the little pig settled into his pretty house, then the wolf happened by. He was still hungry, and he said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."" The wolf didn't care for that at all, and he said, ""I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Ha ha ha,"" said the little pig. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the house in, and he gobbled up the little pig."
31,00:04:32,2021-06-16 16:39:49,Parent,"Now, the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the little pig. So he brought the bricks and set it out building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it. ""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."" But no sooner had the little pig moved in, then he noticed the wolf loitering about, and the wolf, who was still hungry, said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no, not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin."""
32,00:05:15,2021-06-16 16:40:32,Robot,What does loitering mean?
33,00:05:18,2021-06-16 16:40:35,Parent,"So it says, ""But no sooner had the little pig moved in, then he noticed the wolf loitering about."" What does ""loitering"" mean?"
34,00:05:26,2021-06-16 16:40:43,Child,Coming?
35,00:05:31,2021-06-16 16:40:48,Parent,"Loitering means, um, now it means..."
36,00:05:35,2021-06-16 16:40:52,Robot,"Alexandre, what was the wolf doing outside of the third pig's house?"
37,00:05:39,2021-06-16 16:40:56,Child,Blowing the house?
38,00:05:44,2021-06-16 16:41:01,Parent,He wasn't blowing it. What does he look like he's doing?
39,00:05:48,2021-06-16 16:41:05,Child,"Trying to eat, trying to eat the pig."
40,00:05:50,2021-06-16 16:41:07,Parent,(laughs).
41,00:05:54,2021-06-16 16:41:11,Robot,"So ""loitering"" means?"
42,00:05:59,2021-06-16 16:41:16,Parent,"""Loitering"" means... What does loitering mean?"
43,00:06:02,2021-06-16 16:41:19,Child,"Like I will, I will eat you up."
44,00:06:05,2021-06-16 16:41:22,Parent,"(laughs) ""Loitering"" means he's just like, walking around outside and keeps looking at the house. Like, loitering."
45,00:06:15,2021-06-16 16:41:32,Child,Oh.
46,00:06:15,2021-06-16 16:41:32,Parent,Maybe Jibo has a better explanation.
47,00:06:24,2021-06-16 16:41:41,Robot,Terrific.
48,00:06:27,2021-06-16 16:41:44,Parent,"Yep. Well, the wolf had heard that before, and he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" ""Oh, don't do that,"" said the little pig. But the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, until he was quite blue in the face. The house stood firm. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf. And he put on his most dazzling smile, ""Little pig, I was only teasing,"" he said. ""By the way, I hear tell that Farmer Jones has the most scrumptious turnips. Shall we go pick a few?"" ""Oh, I'm much too busy now,"" said the little pig, ""What about tomorrow morning?"" ""Excellent,"" said the wolf, ""I'll come for you at six."""
49,00:07:17,2021-06-16 16:42:34,Parent,"The next morning, the little pig got up at five, hurried off to Farmer Jones' turnip field, picked a basket full of scrumptious turnips, and dashed back home. When the wolf arrived at six, the turnips were already boiling in the pot. ""Sorry, I couldn't wait,"" said the little pig. The wolf tried not to show his displeasure. ""No harm done,"" he said, ""By the way, there is a lovely apple tree down the merry meadow. Shall we go help ourselves to a few apples?"" ""I must cook my turnips,"" said the little pig. ""Let's meet there tomorrow morning."" ""Splendid,"" said the wolf. ""Shall we [inaudible 00:07:59] at five?"""
50,00:08:00,2021-06-16 16:43:17,Parent,"The next morning, the little pig was up at four, and went off for the apples. It took longer than he'd expected to reach merry meadow, and while busy gathering apples in the highest tree, he saw the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree, and made it safely home."
51,00:08:28,2021-06-16 16:43:45,Robot,"I think now is a good time for some questions. Jenny, can you please ask Alexandre a question?"
52,00:08:35,2021-06-16 16:43:52,Parent,Um.
53,00:08:36,2021-06-16 16:43:53,Child,"What means ""shimmering""?"
54,00:08:40,2021-06-16 16:43:57,Parent,"(laughs) Oh, what means ""shimmied down the tree?"" Do you know?"
55,00:08:43,2021-06-16 16:44:00,Child,"That means like, run... Like-"
56,00:08:50,2021-06-16 16:44:07,Parent,"I think he's like, climbing, he's shimmying, like, shaking a little. Like, shimmy."
57,00:08:56,2021-06-16 16:44:13,Child,He's like running and shaking and-
58,00:09:02,2021-06-16 16:44:19,Parent,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah. The next day, the wolf came again. Really, he was quite put out. ""Would you care to go to a fair with me tomorrow?"" ""Why don't we meet there?"" said the little pig. Okay, Alex, can you please stop, stop, honey. Um, ""Would three o'clock suit you?"""
59,00:09:20,2021-06-16 16:44:37,Child,[crosstalk 00:09:20]?
60,00:09:21,2021-06-16 16:44:38,Parent,"""Colossal,"" said the wolf, ""Three it is."" Just to make sure, he will be there at two. [inaudible 00:09:31] your hands. At one in the afternoon, the little pig went, um, to the fair and had a fine time, so fine that he lost track of the hour. Suddenly, out of the corner of his eye, he saw the wolf coming up the hill. Without a minute to spare, the little pig jumped inside an empty butter churn, and rolled down the hill toward the wolf. Well, the wolf was so scared, he ran all the way home."
61,00:10:00,2021-06-16 16:45:17,Parent,"That evening, the wolf went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he'd been by a great, round thing that came down the hill. ""Frightened you, did I?"" said the little pig. ""That great round thing was a butter churn, and I was inside."" This was simply too much for the wolf to stand. ""I've been nice long enough,"" he cried. ""I'm going to eat you up right now."" And he climbed onto the roof. When the little pig saw this, he put a big iron pot in the fireplace and quickly stoked the fire."
62,00:10:40,2021-06-16 16:45:57,Robot,"Jenny, why did the little pig stoke the fire in the big iron pot?"
63,00:10:45,2021-06-16 16:46:02,Parent,"Um, because he needed to make the fire go faster, so he stoked it. And he put the big iron pot there so it'll start boiling water."
64,00:10:59,2021-06-16 16:46:16,Parent,"""Here I come,"" cried the wolf, ""Dinner time!"" ""You can say that again,"" said the little pig. And he cooked the mean, old wolf, and gobbled him up. The end. You want the other three little pigs? Really?"
65,00:11:16,2021-06-16 16:46:33,Child,(laughs) I love it.
66,00:11:21,2021-06-16 16:46:38,Parent,"Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day, mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now, it is time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong, and you will be safe from the big, bad wolf."""
67,00:11:42,2021-06-16 16:46:59,Robot,"Hey Alexandre, why does the mother pig let her piggy kids leave home?"
68,00:11:46,2021-06-16 16:47:03,Child,"Because they're too big for the, for the mother to take, take care of them."
69,00:12:02,2021-06-16 16:47:19,Robot,"Yeah, so they need to build their own houses."
70,00:12:09,2021-06-16 16:47:26,Parent,"The first little pig was a lazy little pig, he built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw, it was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful little pig, he built his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks, it was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks."
71,00:12:40,2021-06-16 16:47:57,Parent,"The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big, bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry, and for his supper, he wanted a pig. The big, bad wolf-"
72,00:12:53,2021-06-16 16:48:10,Robot,"What does ""lurking"" mean?"
73,00:12:55,2021-06-16 16:48:12,Parent,"What does ""lurking"" mean?"
74,00:12:58,2021-06-16 16:48:15,Child,"It's when, it's when he [inaudible 00:12:59] and like, run, running."
75,00:13:03,2021-06-16 16:48:20,Parent,Lurking is like the other word we just used.
76,00:13:07,2021-06-16 16:48:24,Child,"Oh, yeah."
77,00:13:07,2021-06-16 16:48:24,Parent,"What was it? Loitering and lurking are very similar. Like, lurking is like, standing afar, and lurking is staring at something."
78,00:13:19,2021-06-16 16:48:36,Child,"Yes. Staring at something, and like, lurking, like, running, and-"
79,00:13:26,2021-06-16 16:48:43,Parent,"Yeah, like pacing back and forth and staring at something, you know? Lurking."
80,00:13:30,2021-06-16 16:48:47,Child,Yes.
81,00:13:31,2021-06-16 16:48:48,Parent,"Like spying, yeah?"
82,00:13:32,2021-06-16 16:48:49,Child,Yes.
83,00:13:33,2021-06-16 16:48:50,Parent,Lurking in the nearby forest was-
84,00:13:35,2021-06-16 16:48:52,Robot,Perfect.
85,00:13:35,2021-06-16 16:48:52,Parent,"... the big, bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry, and for his supper, he wanted a pig. The big, bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny, chin, chin,"" replied the first little pig. Hey, sit up."
86,00:13:54,2021-06-16 16:49:11,Child,[crosstalk 00:13:54].
87,00:13:54,2021-06-16 16:49:11,Parent,"""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in,"" growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him."
88,00:14:29,2021-06-16 16:49:46,Parent,"Next, the wolf knocked on the second little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in,"" he roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny, chin, chin,"" said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blow the house, stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him."
89,00:14:30,2021-06-16 16:49:47,Parent,"The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. ""The big, bad wolf blew our houses down,"" they cried. ""Quick, come inside,"" said the brother. Minutes later, there was another knock on the door."
90,00:14:47,2021-06-16 16:50:04,Parent,"""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" ""Not by the hair on my chinny, chin, chin."" Said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in."" So the wolf huffed and he puffed, and he huffed and he puffed, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not blow the brick house down."
91,00:15:08,2021-06-16 16:50:25,Robot,I wonder what questions we can come up about third little pig. Can you help me come up with one?
92,00:15:18,2021-06-16 16:50:35,Parent,"How come the wolf is huffing and puffing, and the house, the brick house doesn't come down?"
93,00:15:24,2021-06-16 16:50:41,Child,It's because it's made of brick.
94,00:15:28,2021-06-16 16:50:45,Parent,"Whoa. The big, bad wolf was very angry, ""I'll get you, little piggies,"" he snarled. He climbed up on the roof and crept toward the chimney. Can you sit up straight? Hearing the wolf on the roof, the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with hot, crackling flames."
95,00:15:52,2021-06-16 16:51:09,Robot,Cracking fire. What kind of fire is that?
96,00:15:57,2021-06-16 16:51:14,Child,"Usual fow-, fire."
97,00:16:01,2021-06-16 16:51:18,Parent,"Crackling fire, what does that mean?"
98,00:16:03,2021-06-16 16:51:20,Child,"That means like, it's crackling."
99,00:16:06,2021-06-16 16:51:23,Parent,It has this crackling sound?
100,00:16:08,2021-06-16 16:51:25,Child,Yes.
101,00:16:14,2021-06-16 16:51:31,Robot,I like that.
102,00:16:15,2021-06-16 16:51:32,Parent,"The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house, into the woods, howling. The big, bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again, and they lived happily ever after. The end."
103,00:16:30,2021-06-16 16:51:47,Child,Hmm.
104,00:16:42,2021-06-16 16:51:59,Parent,Really? That's so long. Maybe a short story? Is that what you want?
105,00:16:47,2021-06-16 16:52:04,Child,No. Yes.
106,00:16:49,2021-06-16 16:52:06,Parent,"Yes, sure?"
107,00:16:50,2021-06-16 16:52:07,Child,I don't want-
108,00:16:50,2021-06-16 16:52:07,Parent,You don't want a short story?
109,00:16:51,2021-06-16 16:52:08,Child,No.
110,00:16:53,2021-06-16 16:52:10,Parent,"Ah, Geraldine the Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meows of cats in the courtyard. And, of course, the soft, peeping of mice. But music, never."
111,00:17:14,2021-06-16 16:52:31,Parent,"Then, one morning, in the pantry of an empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese, the largest she has ever seen. Eagerly, she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how could she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery."
112,00:17:40,2021-06-16 16:52:57,Parent,"""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends who loved cheese happily agreed, ""Let's go,"" they said. And off they went. ""It's enormous, it's gigantic, it's immense, it's fantastic,"" they shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed, and pulled, and tugged, and finally, they managed to carried it, carry it to Geraldine's hide out. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese, she dug her little teeth into it, and pulled away, crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. Sit up straight."
113,00:18:17,2021-06-16 16:53:34,Parent,"As her friends carried away their cheese tidbits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw."
114,00:18:45,2021-06-16 16:54:02,Parent,"The ears were those of a giant mouse. Still, partly hidden, of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed, until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Then, the realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly-"
115,00:19:14,2021-06-16 16:54:31,Robot,"Hey Alexandre, what do you think the mouse in the cheese will do?"
116,00:19:20,2021-06-16 16:54:37,Parent,What do you think the cheese mouse is gonna do?
117,00:19:24,2021-06-16 16:54:41,Child,Play music?
118,00:19:28,2021-06-16 16:54:45,Parent,"Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seem to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious, until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music,"" she thought, ""This music be music."" She listened all through the night, until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty window panes."
119,00:19:58,2021-06-16 16:55:15,Parent,"But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer, until it stopped to-, altogether. ""Play, play,"" Geraldine begged, ""Play some more."" But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When-"
120,00:20:22,2021-06-16 16:55:39,Robot,Could you please ask us a question about cheese mouse?
121,00:20:28,2021-06-16 16:55:45,Parent,You ask us a question about the cheese mouse.
122,00:20:38,2021-06-16 16:55:55,Child,"Why did the cheese mouse didn't, um, didn't sing? Didn't..."
123,00:20:41,2021-06-16 16:55:58,Parent,Why didn't he sing? I don't know.
124,00:20:42,2021-06-16 16:55:59,Child,"Why didn't, didn't he, um-"
125,00:20:51,2021-06-16 16:56:08,Parent,"Like, go ""la la la la la la""?"
126,00:20:53,2021-06-16 16:56:10,Child,"Yes, sing."
127,00:20:54,2021-06-16 16:56:11,Parent,"Yeah, he only plays his tail, right?"
128,00:20:55,2021-06-16 16:56:12,Child,Play... Why did he not do it-
129,00:20:55,2021-06-16 16:56:12,Robot,That is a good question.
130,00:20:55,2021-06-16 16:56:12,Child,"... like, now. Like-"
131,00:21:06,2021-06-16 16:56:23,Parent,"That's a good question, so. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to our question. The music began faintly at dusk, and lasted until the break of day. And so, night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight, they lingered in her ears."
132,00:21:25,2021-06-16 16:56:42,Parent,"Then, one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food, and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""But that is not possible,"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" asked the others angrily. ""Because, because, because it is music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" they asked altogether."
133,00:21:54,2021-06-16 16:57:11,Parent,"For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought, then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath, and blew. She blew hard, she puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, and she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry, little tummies hurt. Then, a long, soft beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Other mice came to hear the miracle."
134,00:22:29,2021-06-16 16:57:46,Parent,"When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right, we cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully, ""Now we can eat the cheese, because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummies' content."
135,00:23:00,2021-06-16 16:58:17,Parent,"We're, we're done, we're done."
136,00:23:00,2021-06-16 16:58:17,Robot,What a lovely story. What was your favorite part of this book?
137,00:23:09,2021-06-16 16:58:26,Parent,What was your favorite part?
138,00:23:12,2021-06-16 16:58:29,Child,"Um, the last part."
139,00:23:16,2021-06-16 16:58:33,Robot,Me too. Why?
140,00:23:21,2021-06-16 16:58:38,Parent,Why?
141,00:23:22,2021-06-16 16:58:39,Child,"Because he was singing, and... Nevermind."
142,00:23:34,2021-06-16 16:58:51,Robot,The music was in her.
143,00:23:42,2021-06-16 16:58:59,Child,Do we have to do another story?
144,00:23:45,2021-06-16 16:59:02,Parent,I think we're done. You can ask Jibo.
145,00:23:47,2021-06-16 16:59:04,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
146,00:23:54,2021-06-16 16:59:11,Parent,Okay.
147,00:23:55,2021-06-16 16:59:12,Robot,I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
148,00:24:00,2021-06-16 16:59:17,Parent,"Thank you Jibo, bye bye."
149,00:24:00,2021-06-16 16:59:17,Robot,"Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey with your child together."
