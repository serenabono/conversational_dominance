0,00:00:00,2021-06-17 13:32:30,Child,"Uh, and how did they turned on?"
1,00:00:03,2021-06-17 13:32:33,Robot,"I am not on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
2,00:00:27,2021-06-17 13:32:57,Child,Done. I did that just now.
3,00:00:27,2021-06-17 13:32:57,Parent,"Say, ""I did it."""
4,00:00:28,2021-06-17 13:32:58,Child,I did it.
5,00:00:32,2021-06-17 13:33:02,Parent,Want me to read this part?
6,00:00:32,2021-06-17 13:33:02,Child,You wanna- I want you to read this book.
7,00:00:36,2021-06-17 13:33:06,Parent,Okay.
8,00:00:37,2021-06-17 13:33:07,Child,"You read a long story, I read from the pages on a short story."
9,00:00:41,2021-06-17 13:33:11,Parent,How about you read some of the pages on this one.
10,00:00:43,2021-06-17 13:33:13,Child,No! Too long.
11,00:00:45,2021-06-17 13:33:15,Parent,"Okay. Once upon a time there were three little pigs who lived in a cozy house with their mother. One day mother pig said, ""You are all grown up now. It is time for you to go out into the world and build your own houses. Build them strong and you will be safe from the big bad wolf."
12,00:01:04,2021-06-17 13:33:34,Robot,Why does the mother pig let her piggy kids leave home?
13,00:01:06,2021-06-17 13:33:36,Child,Because they're older.
14,00:01:06,2021-06-17 13:33:36,Robot,Nice.
15,00:01:14,2021-06-17 13:33:44,Parent,The first little pig was a lazy little pig. He built the simplest kind of house so he could have time to rest. His house was made of straw. It was not very strong. The second little pig was a playful little pig. He built his house quickly so he could go out and play. His house was made of sticks. It was not very strong. The third little pig was the smartest pig of all. He listened carefully to mother's advice and built a strong house of bricks.
16,00:01:49,2021-06-17 13:34:19,Child,I knew it. I knew it.
17,00:01:53,2021-06-17 13:34:23,Parent,The little pigs didn't know that lurking in the nearby forest was the big bad wolf. The wolf was very hungry and for his supper he wanted a pig.
18,00:02:08,2021-06-17 13:34:38,Robot,"Luke, what does lurking mean?"
19,00:02:15,2021-06-17 13:34:45,Child,It means [inaudible 00:02:15] walking around.
20,00:02:16,2021-06-17 13:34:46,Parent,Walking around kind of hiding?
21,00:02:17,2021-06-17 13:34:47,Child,Yeah. Mm-hmm (affirmative).
22,00:02:26,2021-06-17 13:34:56,Parent,"The big bad wolf knocked on the first little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" He roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin."" Replied the first little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!"" Growled the wolf. So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the straw house down. The first little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. Next, the wolf knocked on the second little pig's door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" He roared. ""Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin."" Said the second little pig. ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff-"
23,00:03:13,2021-06-17 13:35:43,Child,And I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!
24,00:03:13,2021-06-17 13:35:43,Parent,So the wolf huffed and he puffed and he blew the stick house down. The second little pig ran away as fast as his legs could take him. The third little-
25,00:03:23,2021-06-17 13:35:53,Robot,Time for a question. Megan can you ask us a question about second little pig?
26,00:03:33,2021-06-17 13:36:03,Parent,"What, uh, did the second little pig build his house out of?"
27,00:03:38,2021-06-17 13:36:08,Child,Straw.
28,00:03:39,2021-06-17 13:36:09,Parent,Second little pig.
29,00:03:43,2021-06-17 13:36:13,Child,I mean sticks.
30,00:03:43,2021-06-17 13:36:13,Parent,That's right. Did the sticks hold up when the wolf blew?
31,00:03:48,2021-06-17 13:36:18,Child,No. [inaudible 00:03:48].
32,00:03:49,2021-06-17 13:36:19,Parent,Okay. Are they still- Are- Why not? Yeah.
33,00:03:49,2021-06-17 13:36:19,Child,Cause it doesn't work.
34,00:03:55,2021-06-17 13:36:25,Parent,"The third little pig heard a knock on his door. He was surprised to find his trembling brothers standing on the other side. ""The big bad wolf blew down our- blew our houses down,"" they cried. ""Quick come inside!"" Said their brother. Minutes later there was another knock on the door. ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in!"" ""Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin."" Said the third little pig. ""Then I'll huff-"""
35,00:04:26,2021-06-17 13:36:56,Child,I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house!
36,00:04:28,2021-06-17 13:36:58,Parent,"That's right. So, the wolf huffed and he puffed. And he puffed. And he huffed."
37,00:04:36,2021-06-17 13:37:06,Child,And he puffed. And he puffed. And he huffed. No [inaudible 00:04:39]. He tried. He could not blow the brick house down.
38,00:04:36,2021-06-17 13:37:06,Parent,The big-
39,00:04:50,2021-06-17 13:37:20,Child,"The big bad wolf was very angry. ""I'll get you little pigs!"" [inaudible 00:04:57]. And he climbed the- the- the through the chimney and, uh..."
40,00:05:02,2021-06-17 13:37:32,Parent,He crept toward the chimney.
41,00:05:04,2021-06-17 13:37:34,Child,And he [inaudible 00:05:04].
42,00:05:04,2021-06-17 13:37:34,Parent,You think he's taking them?
43,00:05:09,2021-06-17 13:37:39,Child,Yeah.
44,00:05:09,2021-06-17 13:37:39,Parent,"Cool beans. Hearing the wolf on the roof the third little pig was quick to light a fire. The wolf slid down the chimney and was met with hot, crackly flames."
45,00:05:26,2021-06-17 13:37:56,Child,Pew.
46,00:05:28,2021-06-17 13:37:58,Parent,The wolf's tail was badly scorched. He ran from the house into the woods howling. The big bad wolf never bothered the three little pigs again.
47,00:05:42,2021-06-17 13:38:12,Child,And then.
48,00:05:42,2021-06-17 13:38:12,Robot,Hey Luke. How would the three little pigs feel now?
49,00:05:45,2021-06-17 13:38:15,Child,"Happy. Really, really happy."
50,00:05:51,2021-06-17 13:38:21,Robot,Excellent.
51,00:05:53,2021-06-17 13:38:23,Parent,And they lived...
52,00:05:54,2021-06-17 13:38:24,Child,Happily ever after in the same house.
53,00:06:01,2021-06-17 13:38:31,Parent,In the same house together. The end. Do you wanna do it the way you like?
54,00:06:04,2021-06-17 13:38:34,Robot,That was a great story.
55,00:06:04,2021-06-17 13:38:34,Child,"Yeah, uh."
56,00:06:07,2021-06-17 13:38:37,Robot,Want to read another one?
57,00:06:10,2021-06-17 13:38:40,Child,"Yes. Wait, no I pressed the wrong one. Um, I'm sorry. Wait, actually."
58,00:06:23,2021-06-17 13:38:53,Parent,Have we done all of the short stories?
59,00:06:37,2021-06-17 13:39:07,Child,"Yeah. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. [inaudible 00:06:37]. A told B and B told C. ""I'll meet you at the top of coconut tree."" Uh, ""Whee!"" said D to E to F- said- ""Whee!"" said D to E F G. I'll beat you to the- up the coconut tree. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Will there be enough room? Here comes H up the coconut tree. Uh, I J tag-along K, all on their way up the coconut tree. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Will there be enough room? Look who's coming, L M N O P. Uh-"
60,00:07:11,2021-06-17 13:39:41,Robot,Why do you think they are all going to the top of the coconut tree?
61,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Child,"Uh, maybe to race, to [inaudible 00:07:18]."
62,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Robot,Yeah.
63,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Child,"And Q R S and T U V and uh, still more."
64,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Robot,[crosstalk 00:07:18].
65,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Parent,Do you think they can-
66,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Child,Yeah. Yeah. Cause that happens later in the story.
67,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Parent,"Yeah, and you've read this story before."
68,00:07:17,2021-06-17 13:39:47,Child,"Yeah. There's still more, still more. W and X Y and Z climb up the coconut tree."
69,00:07:17,2021-06-17 13:39:47,Parent,Oh no!
70,00:07:18,2021-06-17 13:39:48,Child,Oh no! Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Pew.
71,00:07:38,2021-06-17 13:40:08,Parent,(laughs).
72,00:07:38,2021-06-17 13:40:08,Child,And the coconuts go on your head.
73,00:07:38,2021-06-17 13:40:08,Parent,Whoa.
74,00:07:57,2021-06-17 13:40:27,Child,And then they crack open.
75,00:07:58,2021-06-17 13:40:28,Parent,Ouch.
76,00:07:59,2021-06-17 13:40:29,Child,And nothing happens to your head.
77,00:07:59,2021-06-17 13:40:29,Parent,Okay.
78,00:08:09,2021-06-17 13:40:39,Child,"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Skit skat skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Everybody running to the coconut tree. Mamas and papas and uncles and aunts hug their little dears and dust off- dust, uh, pants. Help us."
79,00:08:22,2021-06-17 13:40:52,Robot,"Why did the mamas, papas, uncles and aunts look different than the other letters?"
80,00:08:34,2021-06-17 13:41:04,Child,"Because they're [inaudible 00:08:34]. ""Help us!"" Cried A B C. Next from the pile skinned-knee E, D and stubbed-toe E, E Wait."
81,00:08:51,2021-06-17 13:41:21,Parent,And...
82,00:08:53,2021-06-17 13:41:23,Child,And patched up F. Then comes G all out of breath.
83,00:08:57,2021-06-17 13:41:27,Parent,Nice.
84,00:08:59,2021-06-17 13:41:29,Robot,"Luke, why do you think G was out of breath?"
85,00:09:02,2021-06-17 13:41:32,Child,Because G might've ran or maybe he help- he helped them pr- when they fell down the coconut tree.
86,00:09:14,2021-06-17 13:41:44,Parent,"Hm, those are two possible reasons."
87,00:09:18,2021-06-17 13:41:48,Child,H is-
88,00:09:18,2021-06-17 13:41:48,Robot,Maybe it is under other letters. Huh.
89,00:09:21,2021-06-17 13:41:51,Parent,Look. Do you like G? Oh yeah.
90,00:09:21,2021-06-17 13:41:51,Child,"Here, H is tangled up with I."
91,00:09:21,2021-06-17 13:41:51,Parent,Tangled. Mm-hmm (affirmative).
92,00:09:24,2021-06-17 13:41:54,Child,"Tangled. J and K are about to cry. L is knotted like a tie. M is looped. N is stooped. Zero, I mean O is twisted alley-oop. Skit skat spoo- skoodle doot. Flip flop flee. Look who's coming. It's black-eyed P, Q R S, and loose-tooth T. Then U V W wiggle-jiggle free. Last to come, X Y Z. And the sun goes down on the coconut tree. Chicka Chicka Boom Boom. Look, there's a full moon. A is all of the bed, and this is what he said, “Dare double, wait, dare, you can't catch me. I'll beat you to the top of the coconut tree.” Chicka Chicka Boom Boom."
93,00:10:41,2021-06-17 13:43:11,Robot,"Time for a question. Megan, can you ask us a question about coconut tree?"
94,00:10:48,2021-06-17 13:43:18,Parent,"Hey Luke, where do you think coconut trees grow?"
95,00:10:56,2021-06-17 13:43:26,Child,"Uh, I think they grow on [inaudible 00:10:58]."
96,00:10:56,2021-06-17 13:43:26,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
97,00:10:59,2021-06-17 13:43:29,Child,And maybe they grown on war- warm places.
98,00:11:00,2021-06-17 13:43:30,Parent,Warm places. Do they grow in Boston?
99,00:11:07,2021-06-17 13:43:37,Child,"No, cause there isn't that water they will die."
100,00:11:07,2021-06-17 13:43:37,Parent,That's right.
101,00:11:08,2021-06-17 13:43:38,Child,[crosstalk 00:11:08].
102,00:11:07,2021-06-17 13:43:37,Parent,Do they need a warm climate?
103,00:11:13,2021-06-17 13:43:43,Child,"Yup. Can we do this until, uh, the end?"
104,00:11:18,2021-06-17 13:43:48,Parent,"Well, you finished the book. You did it."
105,00:11:20,2021-06-17 13:43:50,Robot,That was a great story.
106,00:11:25,2021-06-17 13:43:55,Others,Yay!
107,00:11:27,2021-06-17 13:43:57,Parent,Uh!
108,00:11:28,2021-06-17 13:43:58,Robot,Want to read another one?
109,00:11:39,2021-06-17 13:44:09,Child,No thank you.
110,00:11:39,2021-06-17 13:44:09,Parent,No?
111,00:11:39,2021-06-17 13:44:09,Child,No thank you.
112,00:11:43,2021-06-17 13:44:13,Robot,Or maybe not?
113,00:11:44,2021-06-17 13:44:14,Child,Not. You said you would [inaudible 00:11:49].
114,00:11:52,2021-06-17 13:44:22,Robot,That was a great story.
115,00:11:53,2021-06-17 13:44:23,Others,Yay!
116,00:11:53,2021-06-17 13:44:23,Parent,Hey.
117,00:11:55,2021-06-17 13:44:25,Robot,That's it for today's session.
118,00:11:57,2021-06-17 13:44:27,Child,[crosstalk 00:11:57] that.
119,00:11:59,2021-06-17 13:44:29,Robot,I had so much fun.
120,00:12:00,2021-06-17 13:44:30,Parent,See you next time.
121,00:12:01,2021-06-17 13:44:31,Robot,I will now stop recording to respect your privacy.
122,00:12:05,2021-06-17 13:44:35,Child,Thank you.
123,00:12:05,2021-06-17 13:44:35,Robot,Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly.
124,00:12:12,2021-06-17 13:44:42,Parent,Do you want to say bye and thank you?
125,00:12:12,2021-06-17 13:44:42,Robot,"Oh, and please complete the story survey with your child together."
126,00:12:14,2021-06-17 13:44:44,Child,Goodbye people.
127,00:12:15,2021-06-17 13:44:45,Robot,Thank you. Bye-bye.
128,00:12:18,2021-06-17 13:44:48,Child,Do you [inaudible 00:12:18] see them?
129,00:12:25,2021-06-17 13:44:55,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). Remember, do the story thing."
130,00:12:25,2021-06-17 13:44:55,Child,Cause it's only for some?
131,00:12:26,2021-06-17 13:44:56,Parent,"Okay, that's it. Do you wanna do one more story? You change your mind? Yeah?"
132,00:12:29,2021-06-17 13:44:59,Child,"Wait, no."
133,00:12:30,2021-06-17 13:45:00,Parent,"No, okay."
