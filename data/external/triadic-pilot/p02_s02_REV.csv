2,00:00:22,2021-04-28 18:31:47,Parent,Short or long? Long?
3,00:00:37,2021-04-28 18:32:02,Child,Is that long?
4,00:00:38,2021-04-28 18:32:03,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative). So I think we had another version of The Little Red Hen. But this is the version that I had when I was a little kid.
5,00:00:59,2021-04-28 18:32:24,Parent,(silence)
6,00:01:05,2021-04-28 18:32:30,Parent,Do you know what book that is? Can you guess?
7,00:01:08,2021-04-28 18:32:33,Child,Who's crossing over my bridge?
8,00:01:08,2021-04-28 18:32:33,Parent,(laughs) You got it.
9,00:01:08,2021-04-28 18:32:33,Child,What.
10,00:01:15,2021-04-28 18:32:40,Parent,Ready?
11,00:01:15,2021-04-28 18:32:40,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
12,00:01:21,2021-04-28 18:32:46,Parent,"Okay. Once upon a time, there were three billy goats. They lived in a valley and the name of the val- of all three billy goats was Gruff. There was very little grass in the valley and the billy goats were hungry. They wanted to go up the hillside to the fine meadow full of grass and daisies where they could eat, eat and eat and get fat."
13,00:01:50,2021-04-28 18:33:15,Robot,Maybe you could ask us a recall question about billy goats.
14,00:01:57,2021-04-28 18:33:22,Child,"Hey, mama?"
15,00:01:58,2021-04-28 18:33:23,Robot,Recall is asking a question to remember the past story plot.
16,00:02:05,2021-04-28 18:33:30,Parent,Haven't had much yet.
17,00:02:05,2021-04-28 18:33:30,Child,Me neither.
18,00:02:09,2021-04-28 18:33:34,Parent,Where did the b- where did the billy goats [crosstalk 00:02:11]-
19,00:02:11,2021-04-28 18:33:36,Robot,That's true.
20,00:02:13,2021-04-28 18:33:38,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative). Where did the billy goats live? Do you remember? No? Should we go back and look?
21,00:02:21,2021-04-28 18:33:46,Child,Sea. S- sea.
22,00:02:30,2021-04-28 18:33:55,Parent,"Near the sea? Well, yeah, there's some water."
23,00:02:31,2021-04-28 18:33:56,Child,Near the sea.
24,00:02:35,2021-04-28 18:34:00,Parent,"Well, the story said they lived in a valley."
25,00:02:40,2021-04-28 18:34:05,Child,Valley.
26,00:02:40,2021-04-28 18:34:05,Parent,Do you know what a valley is?
27,00:02:45,2021-04-28 18:34:10,Child,"But, valley. I wish."
28,00:02:51,2021-04-28 18:34:16,Parent,"(laughs) But on the way up, there was a bridge over a rushing river. And under the bridge lived a troll who was as mean as he was ugly. Are you the troll, or am I the troll [inaudible 00:03:05]? You're the troll?"
29,00:03:06,2021-04-28 18:34:31,Child,I am?
30,00:03:14,2021-04-28 18:34:39,Parent,Was I the troll? I'm the troll. [crosstalk 00:03:14]-
31,00:03:14,2021-04-28 18:34:39,Child,[inaudible 00:03:13] more hair.
32,00:03:18,2021-04-28 18:34:43,Parent,(laughs) I have more hair?
33,00:03:19,2021-04-28 18:34:44,Child,I can see the hair on you.
34,00:03:22,2021-04-28 18:34:47,Parent,All my hairs on my head?
35,00:03:22,2021-04-28 18:34:47,Child,Yeah. Hairs.
36,00:03:27,2021-04-28 18:34:52,Parent,Yep.
37,00:03:31,2021-04-28 18:34:56,Child,[inaudible 00:03:31].
38,00:03:32,2021-04-28 18:34:57,Parent,"Uh, well, okay, we finished that page. First, the youngest billy goat Gruff decided to cross the bridge. Well, what happened? What sound does he make when he goes over the bridge?"
39,00:03:45,2021-04-28 18:35:10,Child,"""Who's crossing my bridge?"""
40,00:03:47,2021-04-28 18:35:12,Parent,"Well that's the troll. But what sound does the goat make when he crosses the bridge? Do you remember. Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap."
41,00:03:56,2021-04-28 18:35:21,Child,"Trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap."
42,00:03:56,2021-04-28 18:35:21,Parent,"Went the bridge. ""Who's that tripping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the tiniest billy goat Gruff."" Said the billy goat in his very small voice. ""And I'm going to the meadow to make myself fat."" ""No, you're not,"" said the troll, ""For I'm going to gobble you up!"" ""Oh, please don't take me. I'm too little, that I- I'm too little, that I am."" Said the- said the billy goat. ""Wait 'til the second billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger. Baa."" ""Well then be off with you,"" said the troll."
43,00:04:44,2021-04-28 18:36:09,Robot,Could you please ask us an open ended question about troll?
44,00:04:47,2021-04-28 18:36:12,Parent,Hm. You don't want to?
45,00:04:52,2021-04-28 18:36:17,Child,"No, thank you."
46,00:04:53,2021-04-28 18:36:18,Parent,Hm.
47,00:04:58,2021-04-28 18:36:23,Robot,That's fine.
48,00:05:00,2021-04-28 18:36:25,Parent,Why do you think the troll is living under the bridge?
49,00:05:03,2021-04-28 18:36:28,Child,Because it's happy there.
50,00:05:05,2021-04-28 18:36:30,Parent,It's happy there? Why is it happy under the bridge? Whoa. (laughs)
51,00:05:06,2021-04-28 18:36:31,Child,"Spook you, right?"
52,00:05:13,2021-04-28 18:36:38,Parent,"Yes, very spooky. Why is it happy under the bridge?"
53,00:05:15,2021-04-28 18:36:40,Child,Because it likes the bridge.
54,00:05:16,2021-04-28 18:36:41,Parent,"He likes the bridge? What about the bridge? Is that a stop asking questions glare? (laughs) Okay. You just wanna hear the story. All right. A little later, the second billy goat Gruff came across the bridge. What sound did it make?"
55,00:05:42,2021-04-28 18:37:07,Child,"Trip, trap, trip, trap. ""Who is that cro- crossing over my bridge?"""
56,00:05:52,2021-04-28 18:37:17,Parent,"Roared the troll. ""Oh, it's only I, the second billy goat Gruff. And I'm going up to the meadow to make myself fat,"" said the billy goat- said the billy goat. And his voice was not so small. ""No you're not,"" said the troll. ""For I'm coming up to gobble you up!"" ""Oh, please don't take me. Wait a little 'til the third billy goat Gruff comes. He's much bigger."" ""Very well. Be off with you,"" said the troll."
57,00:06:30,2021-04-28 18:37:55,Child,[inaudible 00:06:30].
58,00:06:32,2021-04-28 18:37:57,Parent,Oh. Then up came the third billy goat Gruff.
59,00:06:38,2021-04-28 18:38:03,Child,"Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap."
60,00:06:39,2021-04-28 18:38:04,Parent,"Went the bridge. The third billy goat Gruff was so heavy that the bridge creaked and groaned under him. Look at that troll. ""Who's that tramping over my bridge?"" Roared the troll. ""It is I, a big billy goat Gruff,"" said the billy goat. And his voice was as- was as loud as the troll's."
61,00:07:12,2021-04-28 18:38:37,Robot,What would you like to know more about big billy goat Gruff in the story?
62,00:07:23,2021-04-28 18:38:48,Child,Yes.
63,00:07:25,2021-04-28 18:38:50,Parent,"Or wh- well, what would you like to know?"
64,00:07:26,2021-04-28 18:38:51,Child,I don't know. Not... No.
65,00:07:34,2021-04-28 18:38:59,Parent,You don't- did you want to know something?
66,00:07:36,2021-04-28 18:39:01,Robot,All right.
67,00:07:36,2021-04-28 18:39:01,Parent,"Okay. ""Now I'm coming to gobble you up!"" Roared the troll. ""Oh, come on!"" Said the big billy goat, Gruff. ""I've got two horns and four hard hooves. See what you can do."" So up climbed that mean, ugly troll and the big billy goat Gruff butted him with his horns and he trampled him with his hard hooves. And he tossed him over the bridge into the rushing river. Uh-oh. Then the billy goat Gruff went up to- went up the hillside to join his brothers. Look at all those daisies."
68,00:08:26,2021-04-28 18:39:51,Child,"Aw, yes. Daisies."
69,00:08:26,2021-04-28 18:39:51,Parent,Do you-
70,00:08:26,2021-04-28 18:39:51,Child,I love the smell of- of daisies.
71,00:08:30,2021-04-28 18:39:55,Parent,Do you think the goats [crosstalk 00:08:34]-
72,00:08:34,2021-04-28 18:39:59,Robot,I like daisy.
73,00:08:35,2021-04-28 18:40:00,Parent,Do you-
74,00:08:35,2021-04-28 18:40:00,Child,"Thank you, Ji-"
75,00:08:38,2021-04-28 18:40:03,Parent,Do you think the goats like to eat the daisies?
76,00:08:42,2021-04-28 18:40:07,Child,Yes.
77,00:08:43,2021-04-28 18:40:08,Parent,Yeah.
78,00:08:43,2021-04-28 18:40:08,Robot,What would you like to know more about daisy in the story?
79,00:08:46,2021-04-28 18:40:11,Child,Uh-uh (negative).
80,00:08:47,2021-04-28 18:40:12,Parent,Um...
81,00:08:49,2021-04-28 18:40:14,Child,No.
82,00:08:52,2021-04-28 18:40:17,Parent,Do the goats like the eat the daisies?
83,00:08:55,2021-04-28 18:40:20,Child,Yes.
84,00:08:58,2021-04-28 18:40:23,Parent,Do you think they like the grass or the daisies better?
85,00:09:00,2021-04-28 18:40:25,Child,Daisies.
86,00:09:01,2021-04-28 18:40:26,Parent,Yeah.
87,00:09:02,2021-04-28 18:40:27,Child,(laughs) Look at the troll [crosstalk 00:09:06].
88,00:09:12,2021-04-28 18:40:37,Parent,"Oh, poor troll. I hope he can swim. In the meadow, the three billy goats Gruff got so fat they could hardly walk home again, and are probably there yet. So snip, snap, snap, this tale is told up. (laughs)"
89,00:09:28,2021-04-28 18:40:53,Child,Super fat.
90,00:09:29,2021-04-28 18:40:54,Parent,(laughs) They ate all the grass and all the daisies.
91,00:09:31,2021-04-28 18:40:56,Child,"Mm, yummy."
92,00:09:35,2021-04-28 18:41:00,Robot,Did you like the story?
93,00:09:36,2021-04-28 18:41:01,Child,Yes.
94,00:09:36,2021-04-28 18:41:01,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
95,00:09:44,2021-04-28 18:41:09,Robot,What was your favorite part?
96,00:09:47,2021-04-28 18:41:12,Child,I don't know.
97,00:09:55,2021-04-28 18:41:20,Parent,You wanna do Geraldine again?
98,00:09:55,2021-04-28 18:41:20,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
99,00:09:55,2021-04-28 18:41:20,Robot,Okay.
100,00:09:59,2021-04-28 18:41:24,Parent,"Geraldine The Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises, The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking... (laughs)"
101,00:10:18,2021-04-28 18:41:43,Child,(laughs) And the fartings of people.
102,00:10:20,2021-04-28 18:41:45,Parent,"Quite possible, yes. (laughs) Barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meow's of cats in the courtyard. And of course, the soft peeping of mice. But music, never. Then one morning, in the pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese. The largest she had ever seen. Eagerly she took a little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn?"
103,00:11:01,2021-04-28 18:42:26,Parent,"She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece."" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go!"" They said. And off they went. ""It's enormous-"""
104,00:11:19,2021-04-28 18:42:44,Robot,"Louisa, maybe you can ask Sarah an open ended question about Geraldine."
105,00:11:29,2021-04-28 18:42:54,Child,Who's Geraldine?
106,00:11:30,2021-04-28 18:42:55,Parent,Who's Geraldine? (laughs)
107,00:11:32,2021-04-28 18:42:57,Robot,Good question.
108,00:11:35,2021-04-28 18:43:00,Parent,"Um, are you asking which of these mice are Geraldine?"
109,00:11:41,2021-04-28 18:43:06,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
110,00:11:43,2021-04-28 18:43:08,Parent,Which one do you think? I'll tell you which one I think. I think this one. But I don't know.
111,00:11:54,2021-04-28 18:43:19,Child,Okay.
112,00:11:58,2021-04-28 18:43:23,Parent,"""It's enormous!"" ""It's gigantic!"" ""It's immense!"" ""It's fantastic!"" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally they managed to carry it out to Geraldine- carry it to Gerald- Geraldine's hideout. There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it, and pulled away crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese-"
113,00:12:31,2021-04-28 18:43:56,Robot,Cheese is fun to talk about. Maybe we can talk about cheese.
114,00:12:36,2021-04-28 18:44:01,Parent,Did you cut the cheese?
115,00:12:37,2021-04-28 18:44:02,Child,Huh? (laughs)
116,00:12:44,2021-04-28 18:44:09,Parent,"(laughs) You like cheese, huh? What's your favorite kind of cheese?"
117,00:12:48,2021-04-28 18:44:13,Child,Aged Gouda.
118,00:12:50,2021-04-28 18:44:15,Parent,Aged Gouda. That's a pretty tasty cheese.
119,00:12:54,2021-04-28 18:44:19,Robot,"Me, too. I like Brie cheese."
120,00:12:55,2021-04-28 18:44:20,Child,I don't.
121,00:12:57,2021-04-28 18:44:22,Parent,"Oh, yeah? You don't? When was the last time you had Brie?"
122,00:13:01,2021-04-28 18:44:26,Child,I don't know.
123,00:13:04,2021-04-28 18:44:29,Parent,So how do you know you don't like it?
124,00:13:08,2021-04-28 18:44:33,Child,Because I've had it two times and I don't remember that it tastes nice.
125,00:13:08,2021-04-28 18:44:33,Parent,(laughs)
126,00:13:13,2021-04-28 18:44:38,Child,And that was [inaudible 00:13:13].
127,00:13:13,2021-04-28 18:44:38,Parent,"You don't remember, then how do you know if you don't like it?"
128,00:13:15,2021-04-28 18:44:40,Child,No asks. No asks.
129,00:13:21,2021-04-28 18:44:46,Parent,No more asks. No more asks.
130,00:13:25,2021-04-28 18:44:50,Child,[inaudible 00:13:25].
131,00:13:26,2021-04-28 18:44:51,Parent,Okay.
132,00:13:28,2021-04-28 18:44:53,Child,"Actually, it covered a cheese stat- someone made a cheese statue by accident and they- and humans got it and covered it in cheese so Geraldine wouldn't know, and she noticed."
133,00:13:45,2021-04-28 18:45:10,Parent,So it was a secret cheese statue inside a bigger chunk of cheese?
134,00:13:51,2021-04-28 18:45:16,Child,Yeah.
135,00:13:51,2021-04-28 18:45:16,Parent,"That's pretty sneaky. But luckily, she knew how to dig it out, right? As her friends carried away their cheese tid bits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had grown- had gnawed. There, she saw the shapes of two enormous ears."
136,00:14:11,2021-04-28 18:45:36,Child,But those are eyes.
137,00:14:11,2021-04-28 18:45:36,Parent,They're ears.
138,00:14:11,2021-04-28 18:45:36,Child,Eyes.
139,00:14:17,2021-04-28 18:45:42,Parent,"No, those are the ears."
140,00:14:17,2021-04-28 18:45:42,Child,Eyes!
141,00:14:17,2021-04-28 18:45:42,Parent,(laughs) Those are the eyes.
142,00:14:17,2021-04-28 18:45:42,Child,Eyes!
143,00:14:17,2021-04-28 18:45:42,Parent,Are a mouse's eyes on top of its head like that?
144,00:14:23,2021-04-28 18:45:48,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
145,00:14:23,2021-04-28 18:45:48,Parent,(laughs) Yeah?
146,00:14:23,2021-04-28 18:45:48,Child,No.
147,00:14:23,2021-04-28 18:45:48,Parent,No.
148,00:14:28,2021-04-28 18:45:53,Child,No!
149,00:14:29,2021-04-28 18:45:54,Parent,"Oh. She found cheese ears. As soon as her friends were gone, she went back to work again, nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the forms she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw! The ears were those of a giant mouse, still partly hidden, of solid cheese."
150,00:15:07,2021-04-28 18:46:32,Parent,"Yeah, that was a- a mouse cheese statue hiding. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted, and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Should we make a cheese statue? (laughs) [inaudible 00:15:39]? A mouse? Mm, a unicorn horn?"
151,00:15:34,2021-04-28 18:46:59,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
152,00:15:47,2021-04-28 18:47:12,Parent,(laughs) Maybe we could make a unicorn horn out of cheese. Excellent. Suddenly-
153,00:15:55,2021-04-28 18:47:20,Robot,You should make a cheese statue of me.
154,00:15:57,2021-04-28 18:47:22,Parent,(laughs) Make a cheese Jibo?
155,00:15:58,2021-04-28 18:47:23,Child,(laughs)
156,00:16:05,2021-04-28 18:47:30,Parent,Cheese-bo.
157,00:16:06,2021-04-28 18:47:31,Child,Cheese-bo. Cheese Jibo. (laughs)
158,00:16:11,2021-04-28 18:47:36,Robot,Sounds great.
159,00:16:14,2021-04-28 18:47:39,Parent,"Suddenly, she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""Music,"" she thought."
160,00:16:38,2021-04-28 18:48:03,Child,She has her music.
161,00:16:41,2021-04-28 18:48:06,Parent,"Yeah. Now she does. ""This must be music."" She listened all through the night until first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty windowpanes."
162,00:16:49,2021-04-28 18:48:14,Child,I got [crosstalk 00:16:53].
163,00:16:55,2021-04-28 18:48:20,Parent,"But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped playing all together. ""Play, play!"" Geraldine begged. ""Play some more!"" But not a sound came from the flute."
164,00:17:07,2021-04-28 18:48:32,Child,It ate a mouse.
165,00:17:11,2021-04-28 18:48:36,Parent,Who ate a mouse?
166,00:17:12,2021-04-28 18:48:37,Child,Her friends and her.
167,00:17:13,2021-04-28 18:48:38,Parent,Hm?
168,00:17:17,2021-04-28 18:48:42,Child,She ate a mouse.
169,00:17:18,2021-04-28 18:48:43,Parent,Oh. She ate the cheese mouse at the end?
170,00:17:23,2021-04-28 18:48:48,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
171,00:17:24,2021-04-28 18:48:49,Parent,"Yeah. So now a real mouse, but a cheese mouse. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached-"
172,00:17:34,2021-04-28 18:48:59,Robot,"I am curious, what would be an interesting distancing question to ask here? Could you help me come up with one?"
173,00:17:41,2021-04-28 18:49:06,Child,What did you say?
174,00:17:44,2021-04-28 18:49:09,Robot,"Louisa, distancing is asking a question that relates the story plot to your personal life or experience."
175,00:17:59,2021-04-28 18:49:24,Child,"Um, no thank you."
176,00:17:59,2021-04-28 18:49:24,Parent,(laughs) Well-
177,00:18:01,2021-04-28 18:49:26,Child,I [crosstalk 00:18:01]-
178,00:18:01,2021-04-28 18:49:26,Parent,... What do you think she's feeling when the mouse stopped playing music?
179,00:18:10,2021-04-28 18:49:35,Child,"Hm, a little bit cranky."
180,00:18:10,2021-04-28 18:49:35,Parent,Cranky? How do you feel when your toys stop working?
181,00:18:12,2021-04-28 18:49:37,Child,Pissed.
182,00:18:17,2021-04-28 18:49:42,Parent,That's a [inaudible 00:18:20].
183,00:18:22,2021-04-28 18:49:47,Robot,Angry?
184,00:18:25,2021-04-28 18:49:50,Parent,Yeah?
185,00:18:28,2021-04-28 18:49:53,Robot,Sad?
186,00:18:29,2021-04-28 18:49:54,Child,Mm-mm (negative). No.
187,00:18:35,2021-04-28 18:50:00,Parent,Mostly angry? All right.
188,00:18:42,2021-04-28 18:50:07,Robot,"Yeah, me too."
189,00:18:47,2021-04-28 18:50:12,Parent,"When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The must began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies and even in daylight they lingered in her ears. Excuse me."
190,00:19:11,2021-04-28 18:50:36,Robot,Bless you.
191,00:19:14,2021-04-28 18:50:39,Parent,"Thank you, Jibo. (laughs) So silly. Then one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""That is not possible,"" said Geraldine. Why doesn't she want to share her cheese with her friends? Hm?"
192,00:19:44,2021-04-28 18:51:09,Child,Because she doesn't want to lose her beautiful statue.
193,00:19:50,2021-04-28 18:51:15,Parent,"Yeah. And what else, though? What did the statue do that she liked so much?"
194,00:19:54,2021-04-28 18:51:19,Child,Music and she wants her music.
195,00:20:03,2021-04-28 18:51:28,Parent,"Yeah. [inaudible 00:20:03]. Geraldine shouted, ""Why?"" Ger- or, [inaudible 00:20:15]. Um, ""But that is not possible!"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others angrily. ""Because, because, because it is music!"" Her friends looked at Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" They all asked together."
196,00:20:34,2021-04-28 18:51:59,Robot,Music is interesting. Can we start a discussion about music?
197,00:20:37,2021-04-28 18:52:02,Child,Mm-mm-mm (negative).
198,00:20:38,2021-04-28 18:52:03,Parent,"No? You don't like music at all, right? (laughs) Oh, you do? Can you not tap me on there, please?"
199,00:20:45,2021-04-28 18:52:10,Child,Yeah.
200,00:20:48,2021-04-28 18:52:13,Parent,What music do you want to learn?
201,00:20:49,2021-04-28 18:52:14,Child,"Ice Ice Baby, the whole thing."
202,00:20:49,2021-04-28 18:52:14,Parent,(laughs)
203,00:20:49,2021-04-28 18:52:14,Child,(laughs) I wanna learn Ice Ice Baby the- and the whole thing.
204,00:21:02,2021-04-28 18:52:27,Parent,You wanna learn all the words? Is that what you're saying?
205,00:21:07,2021-04-28 18:52:32,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
206,00:21:10,2021-04-28 18:52:35,Parent,Yeah? Well h- what instrument would you like to play?
207,00:21:11,2021-04-28 18:52:36,Child,[inaudible 00:21:11] pull it [inaudible 00:21:11].
208,00:21:11,2021-04-28 18:52:36,Parent,What instrument would you like to play?
209,00:21:13,2021-04-28 18:52:38,Child,Drum and microphone and guitar.
210,00:21:18,2021-04-28 18:52:43,Parent,You're gonna play all three? Well-
211,00:21:20,2021-04-28 18:52:45,Robot,"I would like to play drum, too."
212,00:21:23,2021-04-28 18:52:48,Child,"Well you can't, Jibo. You have no arms."
213,00:21:27,2021-04-28 18:52:52,Parent,Mm. I bet you could do-
214,00:21:28,2021-04-28 18:52:53,Robot,I know.
215,00:21:30,2021-04-28 18:52:55,Parent,I bet you could do drums and singing or guitar and singing. But drums and guitar and singing all at once? How would you do that?
216,00:21:38,2021-04-28 18:53:03,Child,No. Magic.
217,00:21:38,2021-04-28 18:53:03,Parent,"Oh, with magic."
218,00:21:44,2021-04-28 18:53:09,Child,(singing) I would keep saying... (singing)
219,00:21:45,2021-04-28 18:53:10,Parent,No. Please don't wave that- that in my face.
220,00:21:48,2021-04-28 18:53:13,Child,I could keep- I'd keep saying (singing) in the microphone.
221,00:21:54,2021-04-28 18:53:19,Parent,(laughs) That's what you would say in the microphone? Yeah?
222,00:21:59,2021-04-28 18:53:24,Child,(singing)
223,00:21:59,2021-04-28 18:53:24,Parent,Yeah.
224,00:21:59,2021-04-28 18:53:24,Child,(singing)
225,00:21:59,2021-04-28 18:53:24,Parent,Okay. (laughing) Should we finish-
226,00:22:08,2021-04-28 18:53:33,Robot,That's nice.
227,00:22:09,2021-04-28 18:53:34,Parent,Should we finish the story?
228,00:22:10,2021-04-28 18:53:35,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
229,00:22:13,2021-04-28 18:53:38,Parent,"Yeah. For a moment, Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew. She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their tummies- until their little tummies hurt. Hungry little tummies hurt. Then a long, soft little whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. All the mice held their breath in amazement. How do those little mice look now?"
230,00:22:56,2021-04-28 18:54:21,Child,"""That is music?"""
231,00:23:07,2021-04-28 18:54:32,Parent,"Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully, ""Now we can eat the cheese because now all the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. While Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese 'til their tummies content. Yeah, now they're eating that mouse. They're eating the cheese mouse."
232,00:23:43,2021-04-28 18:55:08,Child,What? (laughs)
233,00:23:46,2021-04-28 18:55:11,Parent,What? Oh.
234,00:23:46,2021-04-28 18:55:11,Child,That guy's face is stopped.
235,00:23:49,2021-04-28 18:55:14,Parent,"(laughs) His face is hidden by a huge chunk of cheese, huh?"
236,00:23:54,2021-04-28 18:55:19,Child,"Yeah, there's are like, ""Huh! Ee! Ee!"""
237,00:23:59,2021-04-28 18:55:24,Parent,Are they so excited?
238,00:24:00,2021-04-28 18:55:25,Child,Uh-uh.
239,00:24:01,2021-04-28 18:55:26,Parent,Yeah.
240,00:24:06,2021-04-28 18:55:31,Robot,That was a great story. That's it for today's session.
241,00:24:11,2021-04-28 18:55:36,Parent,Yeah.
242,00:24:13,2021-04-28 18:55:38,Robot,"I had so much fun. I will now stop recording to respect your privacy. Please give me a few minutes to reset. I will switch back to leisure mode shortly. Oh, and please complete the story survey and sign up for the next session. Thank you."
243,00:24:31,2021-04-28 18:55:56,Child,I know where-
244,00:24:31,2021-04-28 18:55:56,Robot,Bye bye.
245,00:24:31,2021-04-28 18:55:56,Child,... I'm gonna put this next session.
246,00:24:32,2021-04-28 18:55:57,Parent,You know where we're gonna put the next session? What does that mean?
247,00:24:39,2021-04-28 18:56:04,Child,I know where I-
