29,00:01:50,2021-05-16 08:33:52,Robot,"We will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo story time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."

32,00:02:06,2021-05-16 08:34:08,Parent,"The little red hen by Jerry Pikney, Pinkney. The little red hen greeted the sun with a cheery, ""good morning."" It was good to be-, going to another busy day. Sounds like our day. Well hunting for worms and berries for her young ones she came upon some strange seeds. Ever so carefully she scooped them up then headed home. See she has in her hand."

36,00:02:39,2021-05-16 08:34:41,Parent,"On the way home... Or On the way she greeted her neighbors the short brown dog, the thin gray rat, the tall black goat and the round pink pig. ""I found these seeds,"" she said. Can you ah... Can any of you tal- No I'm gonna need you to do that [inaudible 00:02:58]. Can any of you tell me what they are? ""They're wheat seeds,"" said one of the animals, ""if you plant them they'll grow into wheat for baking."" ""Who will help me plant these seeds?"" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I,"" said the rat. ""Not I,"" said the goat. That sound familiar now doesn't it?"
37,00:03:22,2021-05-16 08:35:24,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
38,00:03:23,2021-05-16 08:35:25,Parent,"""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Surely you will,"" the little red hen said to the dog, ""you are so fond of digging."" ""Not I,"" said the dog. See that?"
39,00:03:34,2021-05-16 08:35:36,Child,Mm.
40,00:03:38,2021-05-16 08:35:40,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). All right. ""Very well then,"" said the little red hen, ""I will plant them myself."" She dug holes in the ground and dropped the seeds in. A very busy hen she was."
41,00:03:51,2021-05-16 08:35:53,Child,She did that.
42,00:03:51,2021-05-16 08:35:53,Parent,"Everyday the little red hen scratched for food to feed the young ones. She also found time to care for the seedlings. She and chicks watched as the wheat grew strong and bright. ""It is now time for harvesting,"" said the little red hen. Sorry. They sent us the timer. ""Who will help..."" (Coughs)."
43,00:04:12,2021-05-16 08:36:14,Child,[crosstalk 00:04:12].
44,00:04:12,2021-05-16 08:36:14,Parent,"(Coughs). We'll eat as soon as we're done. ""Who will help me cut and brush the wheat?"" Asked she. ""Not I,"" said the goat. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Not I,"" said the dog. ""Surely you will,"" the little red hen said to the rat, ""you can use your tail to chop it."" [inaudible 00:04:35]. ""Not I,"" said the rat. ""Very well then. I will do it myself,"" said the little red hen. After snapping the stalks with her beak she separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen she was."
45,00:04:51,2021-05-16 08:36:53,Child,(Whispers)..
46,00:04:51,2021-05-16 08:36:53,Robot,(Sound effect). How does the little red hen get the stalks?
47,00:04:59,2021-05-16 08:37:01,Parent,How does she get to the stalk?
48,00:05:00,2021-05-16 08:37:02,Child,Mm.
49,00:05:03,2021-05-16 08:37:05,Parent,Just said. What's she do with her beak?
50,00:05:13,2021-05-16 08:37:15,Child,Um (whispers).
51,00:05:16,2021-05-16 08:37:18,Parent,"Okay. Tell Jibo. You're being shy or something. It says active snipping the stalks with her beak. She separated the grain with her claws. A very busy hen she was. It means, yeah, it means that she cut 'em with her beak. Her beaks are sharp, right."
52,00:05:28,2021-05-16 08:37:30,Child,Yeah.
53,00:05:29,2021-05-16 08:37:31,Parent,"Then she took off the, the grain from the top of the stem."
54,00:05:29,2021-05-16 08:37:31,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
55,00:05:32,2021-05-16 08:37:34,Parent,"Okay. ""Who will help me take the grain to the mill?"" Asked the little red hen. ""Not I,"" said the pig. ""Not I,"" said the dog. ""Not I,"" said the rat. (Yawns). I'm sorry, excuse me. ""Surely you will,"" the little red hen said to the goat, ""you are strong and steady and it's a lovely day to take out, take out your cart."" ""Not I,"" said the goat. ""Very well then,"" said the little red hen, ""I will do it myself. So she fetched her shawl. It's just like a sweater you put over your shoulders. Then trudged off to the mill. Mr Miller ground her grain into flour and even gave her a jar of berry jam. The little red hen thanked him and began her long trek home."
56,00:06:23,2021-05-16 08:38:25,Robot,(Sound effect). I forgot what shawl means. What does shawl mean?

What do you thinks going to happen?"
70,00:07:30,2021-05-16 08:39:32,Child,They're all going to say yes to eating.
71,00:07:35,2021-05-16 08:39:37,Parent,"(Laughs) you remembered from the last one, when we read it last. ""Very well then,"" said the little red hen, ""I will do it myself."" She mixed the flour with yeast, salt and water, then kneaded the dough. It's like you push on the, on the dough to roll it out and to form it to make it into the shape that you want it to be."
72,00:07:53,2021-05-16 08:39:55,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
73,00:07:54,2021-05-16 08:39:56,Parent,"She shaped it into a loaf and put it in the oven. At last the bread was done. As the little red hen took the hot loaf out of the oven a tasty aroma circled the barnyard. (Sniffs). What does that mean, aroma? (Sniffs). What am I doing? (Sniffs)."
74,00:07:54,2021-05-16 08:39:56,Child,Smelling.

""I surely will,"" said the short brown dog. ""I surely will,"" said the thin gray rat. ""I surely will,"" said the tall black goat. ""I surely will,"" said the round pink pig. ""Hmm, oh no you won't,"" said the little red hen, ""you did not help me plant the seed, nor thresh the wheat, nor take the grain to the miller, nor bake the bread."" The end."

The days into minutes and on a farm sometimes it hap- It, um, something is happening every minute. Animals don't know there is such a thing as a year, but they do know about seasons. Animals know when the cold will come and they grow heavy overcoats. Like it means that their hair, their fur gets thicker during the winters."
98,00:10:42,2021-05-16 08:42:44,Child,My mom.
99,00:10:43,2021-05-16 08:42:45,Parent,Meh. During the winters [inaudible 00:10:47]. So they know when it is summer and they shed then. That means they shed their fur.
100,00:10:52,2021-05-16 08:42:54,Child,Why's that smell so gross.
101,00:10:56,2021-05-16 08:42:58,Parent,"I don't know. Flowers [inaudible 00:10:56]. Okay. When it is hot they look for shade and in winter they look for shelter. Please stop. People have names for what they call the months of the year. You know the months of the year, right? Stop. Well stop smelling it. You're being ridiculous. We could start with any month as far as the animals are concerned, but it is usual to begin with... What? What's the beginning of the year called? Ja-"
102,00:11:22,2021-05-16 08:43:24,Child,January.
103,00:11:24,2021-05-16 08:43:26,Parent,"January. January is a winter month. Look. The ground is covered with the snow and cows stay in a barnyard when the ground's frozen. So do the chickens, but not many eggs are laid in January. The day."

121,00:12:53,2021-05-16 08:44:55,Child,What about-
122,00:12:54,2021-05-16 08:44:56,Parent,"You're like a little, like a little horse or a sheep. There is a hay and there is hay and grain to eat. Even the wild deer come near the farm hoping to find a little salt or a windfall. Windfall apple under the snow. Like a apple that fall of the tree during [inaudible 00:13:12], during the fall. February follows January. The forest pond is frozen solid all but a marshy place where the spring water feeds the pond. The children are having a skating party. When they are cold they sit by the fire and toast their toes and noses. The geese play in the icy water all winter. You'd think their bare feet would freeze but they never do. Maybe the have extra thick feet so they don't freeze, right."
123,00:12:54,2021-05-16 08:44:56,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
124,00:13:44,2021-05-16 08:45:46,Parent,"The noisy rooks are having a circus. They mean like the crows. They toss and tumble on the trapezes of their branches. Trapeze is like, it's like a, um, what you call it? Trampoline."

136,00:14:55,2021-05-16 08:46:57,Parent,Look at the pictures.
137,00:14:55,2021-05-16 08:46:57,Child,"Mm. Um, I don't know."
138,00:15:02,2021-05-16 08:47:04,Parent,What do you see in the pictures?
139,00:15:09,2021-05-16 08:47:11,Child,I see goats and [crosstalk 00:15:09].
140,00:15:09,2021-05-16 08:47:11,Parent,What do you notice about every picture? There are what?
141,00:15:13,2021-05-16 08:47:15,Child,That's a goat.
142,00:15:14,2021-05-16 08:47:16,Parent,Yeah.
143,00:15:14,2021-05-16 08:47:16,Child,And that's a big horn.
144,00:15:18,2021-05-16 08:47:20,Parent,"So there's babies in the picture. It says the pony has given birth to a foal. She loves him and looks after him. And the milk cow has a new calf. They all have babies. Spring is know for bringing on the babies. You're sister came in spring. Remember last year? She loves him and gives him her milk. The good, gray barn cat has her litter of kittens in the hay rack. [inaudible 00:15:42]."
145,00:15:41,2021-05-16 08:47:43,Child,"Yeah, under her."
146,00:15:41,2021-05-16 08:47:43,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative). The mother, the mother ewe, ewe has two new lambs. The nanny goat has a new kid too. You know baby goats are called kids."
147,00:15:57,2021-05-16 08:47:59,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
148,00:15:58,2021-05-16 08:48:00,Parent,"Is that funny? Um, all the animal mothers are proud and protective and full of love. March is windy and rainy but when the sun does shine it shines more brightly and the days are longer. There are signs of spring everywhere. The robins are back. They're busy building their nests. A wild duck is in the marsh. Merry gold. Mm-hmm (affirmative). The rooster wakes everyone early in the morning, or earlier in the morning, and the geese are cranky (quacks). They must have laid an egg. The meadow mice are out looking... mm-hmm (affirmative). The meadow mice are out looking around. Mm-hmm (affirmative), thank you for pointing. The mad march care is brewing in all directions. The i- Right. The ice on the pond has melted and there are pussy willows everywhere. Look at that. They're like plants. The horses have found a little grass under the [crosstalk 00:16:58]."
149,00:16:58,2021-05-16 08:49:00,Child,Pussy willow.
150,00:16:59,2021-05-16 08:49:01,Parent,"Yeah, [inaudible 00:17:00]. The horses have found a little grass under the last patches of snow. They lie down in the pale sunshine. You don't see that often, you don't see that often if the ground is frozen. April is a spring month. You can tell that the spring is here by all the eggs. Eggs in the barn, in the fields, in the trees. Please sit. Under the caves, everywhere."
151,00:17:25,2021-05-16 08:49:27,Robot,(Sound effect). I think now is a good time for some consistency questions.
152,00:17:32,2021-05-16 08:49:34,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
153,00:17:32,2021-05-16 08:49:34,Robot,Adam can you please ask Michelle a question?
154,00:17:35,2021-05-16 08:49:37,Child,"Mom. Wh- when the, um, chickens lay their eggs in spring, what day?"
155,00:17:46,2021-05-16 08:49:48,Parent,"Oh it doesn't say what day. It just means that they, they lay more eggs in the spring than they do in winter."
156,00:17:52,2021-05-16 08:49:54,Child,Oh.
157,00:17:54,2021-05-16 08:49:56,Parent,Right. Good question. So the good old brown hen... It's not closed all the way. Could you use your foot? The good old brown hen has been busy sitting on eggs for 21 days. Now her baby chicks are hatching.
158,00:18:11,2021-05-16 08:50:13,Child,[crosstalk 00:18:11].
159,00:18:11,2021-05-16 08:50:13,Parent,It must be hard to pick your way out of an egg but the chicks are pretty and fluffy in no time. The robins are already hatching eggs-
160,00:18:21,2021-05-16 08:50:23,Child,Wait [crosstalk 00:18:22]
161,00:18:21,2021-05-16 08:50:23,Parent,And their nests...
162,00:18:24,2021-05-16 08:50:26,Child,[inaudible 00:18:24].
163,00:18:26,2021-05-16 08:50:28,Parent,And their mimics like way. The silly goose has laid an egg in the middle of nowhere.
164,00:18:29,2021-05-16 08:50:31,Child,[crosstalk 00:18:29].
165,00:18:29,2021-05-16 08:50:31,Parent,"She must be crazy- Okay, um. This... He's not. This big bird is laying her egg in a little bird's nest. Ha, she must be coo-coo. Coo-coo, coo-coo. This little bird is feeding her babies. She must wonder why one baby is so big. That's not her baby. Look. This big bird came and sat in her nest and is waiting for that mommy bird to feed her. She must wonder why one baby is so big, right? Here's a basket of colored eggs among the flowers. What does that represent?"
166,00:19:05,2021-05-16 08:51:07,Child,That's a big bird. That's the big bird.
167,00:19:05,2021-05-16 08:51:07,Parent,Yeah.
168,00:19:05,2021-05-16 08:51:07,Child,And that's the mom?
169,00:19:12,2021-05-16 08:51:14,Parent,What's going on in this basket with all that colored eggs? What do we do with colored eggs in a basket.
170,00:19:19,2021-05-16 08:51:21,Child,Paint them.
171,00:19:20,2021-05-16 08:51:22,Parent,Well they are painted but it's for...
172,00:19:22,2021-05-16 08:51:24,Child,E- easter.

174,00:19:26,2021-05-16 08:51:28,Child,Easter.
175,00:19:26,2021-05-16 08:51:28,Parent,"[inaudible 00:19:26] spring. No one has found it yet. Dogs steal eggs when they can, when they can find them and they hurry and carry them away."
176,00:19:35,2021-05-16 08:51:37,Child,(Laughs).
177,00:19:35,2021-05-16 08:51:37,Parent,"Perhaps dogs makes me-, perhaps dog, dogs make mess too. May days are warm. We're in May. The animals are uncomfortable with their heavy coats."
178,00:19:46,2021-05-16 08:51:48,Child,(Laughs).
179,00:19:47,2021-05-16 08:51:49,Parent,Oh no. What's behind that dog? Can't even see that. Someone's hiding. What do you thinks hiding behind the dog?
180,00:19:55,2021-05-16 08:51:57,Child,I don't know.
181,00:19:55,2021-05-16 08:51:57,Parent,Meow.
182,00:19:55,2021-05-16 08:51:57,Child,Cat.

184,00:19:55,2021-05-16 08:51:57,Child,Cat.
185,00:20:00,2021-05-16 08:52:02,Parent,All right. Can you sit down?
186,00:20:01,2021-05-16 08:52:03,Child,It's a cat.
187,00:20:01,2021-05-16 08:52:03,Parent,"That's it. They will all be cooler without them. Everyone get a haircut one way or another. Ha, you got a haircut in May. How funny. Yeah look the, they sheared the ram so now he's losing, he's losing his fur and so he won't be so hot in the summer. The wooly sheep are shorn. The black sheep, the dog is shorn at the same time. He's a sheep dog. Not a very fancy fit. She will scarcely be recognizable without her long curls, but they will grow back in time for winter and she will look herself again."
188,00:20:41,2021-05-16 08:52:43,Child,Why's his ta-

190,00:20:44,2021-05-16 08:52:46,Child,"Yeah, kittens."
191,00:20:47,2021-05-16 08:52:49,Parent,Woo hoo. It's tail fun. Even the chickens malt. The rooster won't be himself until he can parade his fine tail that ends again. (Clucks).
192,00:20:55,2021-05-16 08:52:57,Child,(Clucking).
193,00:21:03,2021-05-16 08:53:05,Parent,(Clucking). So [crosstalk 00:21:03] even though it's cool.
194,00:21:04,2021-05-16 08:53:06,Child,Sound.
195,00:21:04,2021-05-16 08:53:06,Parent,Let me see.

199,00:21:14,2021-05-16 08:53:16,Parent,"It must be embarrassing to lose all your clothes all at once. Cats don't need clipping, they shed their coats on other people's clothes and furniture. Like your puppy. He sheds his hair everywhere, right?"
200,00:21:14,2021-05-16 08:53:16,Child,Yeah.
201,00:21:14,2021-05-16 08:53:16,Parent,Okay.

203,00:21:25,2021-05-16 08:53:27,Parent,Please don't do that.
204,00:21:25,2021-05-16 08:53:27,Child,"Bye, bye, bye."
205,00:21:33,2021-05-16 08:53:35,Robot,How do you like this story Adam?

211,00:21:50,2021-05-16 08:53:52,Parent,"Think about it. Something that you learned from the book that you didn't know, that we talked about."
212,00:21:54,2021-05-16 08:53:56,Child,"That chickens n-, lay their eggs on new spring."
213,00:22:02,2021-05-16 08:54:04,Parent,Well they lay them all year round but they lay m-

217,00:22:12,2021-05-16 08:54:14,Parent,Yeah. Pretty cool.
