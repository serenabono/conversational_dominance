3,00:00:12,2021-04-26 17:36:28,Robot,"I am now on story time mode. My camera will now turn on and start audio and video recording. I may behave a little differently in story time mode. I will not be responding to, ""Hey Jibo,"" and I will not turn blue, but we can still chat. Let's get started. Now, we will be reading story books together. If you haven't already, please open the Jibo Story Time app. Let's go ahead and select a book on the app."
4,00:00:45,2021-04-26 17:37:01,Child,"Choose, um..."
5,00:00:47,2021-04-26 17:37:03,Parent,Should we look at the long stories this time?

9,00:00:49,2021-04-26 17:37:05,Parent,Why don't you go ahead and pick which one you wanna do?
10,00:00:59,2021-04-26 17:37:15,Child,I love this one.
11,00:01:04,2021-04-26 17:37:20,Parent,"Oh, The Little Red Hen? Where do you read The Little Red Hen? At school?"
12,00:01:08,2021-04-26 17:37:24,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
13,00:01:09,2021-04-26 17:37:25,Parent,In after school or in regular school?
14,00:01:15,2021-04-26 17:37:31,Child,Regular school. I used to love it.
15,00:01:18,2021-04-26 17:37:34,Parent,Like at TCC? Or...
16,00:01:19,2021-04-26 17:37:35,Child,TCC.
17,00:01:22,2021-04-26 17:37:38,Parent,"All right. One summer day, The Little Red Hen found a grain of wheat. ""A grain of wheat!"" said The Little Red Hen to herself, ""I will plant it."" She asked The Duck, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said The Duck."
18,00:01:45,2021-04-26 17:38:01,Robot,Why do you think she asked The Duck to help?
19,00:01:52,2021-04-26 17:38:08,Child,Because she is napping?
20,00:01:54,2021-04-26 17:38:10,Parent,She was taking a nap? Yeah? Okay.
21,00:02:04,2021-04-26 17:38:20,Child,"Oh, no."
22,00:02:08,2021-04-26 17:38:24,Parent,Okay.
23,00:02:08,2021-04-26 17:38:24,Child,Playing dress-up.
24,00:02:09,2021-04-26 17:38:25,Parent,(laughs) She asked-
25,00:02:09,2021-04-26 17:38:25,Child,Or being guard.
26,00:02:11,2021-04-26 17:38:27,Parent,"Yeah, they're playing guard... or, pretending to be guards. She asked The Goose, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said The Goose."
27,00:02:24,2021-04-26 17:38:40,Child,"Same, not as nice."
28,00:02:31,2021-04-26 17:38:47,Parent,"She asked The Cat, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said The Cat. Why do you think The Cat said no?"
29,00:02:36,2021-04-26 17:38:52,Child,'Cause he was fishing.
30,00:02:42,2021-04-26 17:38:58,Parent,Yeah. What do you think The Pig's gonna say?
31,00:02:52,2021-04-26 17:39:08,Child,"""No."""
32,00:02:53,2021-04-26 17:39:09,Parent,"No. She asked The Pig, ""Will you help me plant this grain of wheat?"" ""Not I,"" said the pig."
33,00:02:59,2021-04-26 17:39:15,Child,She's doing music practice.
34,00:03:03,2021-04-26 17:39:19,Parent,Yeah.
35,00:03:04,2021-04-26 17:39:20,Robot,"Hey, Sarah."

37,00:03:08,2021-04-26 17:39:24,Parent,"Hey, Jibo."
38,00:03:13,2021-04-26 17:39:29,Robot,What is The Pig doing in the picture?
39,00:03:17,2021-04-26 17:39:33,Parent,What's The Pig doing?
40,00:03:18,2021-04-26 17:39:34,Child,H- eating watermelon and doing music practice.
41,00:03:24,2021-04-26 17:39:40,Robot,"Uh-huh, correct."
42,00:03:31,2021-04-26 17:39:47,Parent,"""Then I will plant it myself,"" said The Little Red Hen. And she did. Soon, the wheat grew tall and The Little Red Hen knew it was time to reap it. ""Who will help me reap the wheat?"" She asked. One stalk of wheat. ""Not I,"" said The Duck. ""Not I,"" said The Goose. ""Not I,"" said The Cat. ""Not I,"" said The Pig. ""Then I will reap it myself."" Said The Little Red Hen. And she did."
43,00:04:14,2021-04-26 17:40:30,Robot,Have you ever asked your friends to help you and they said no? How did you feel?
44,00:04:22,2021-04-26 17:40:38,Child,Sad.
45,00:04:23,2021-04-26 17:40:39,Parent,You felt sad?
46,00:04:23,2021-04-26 17:40:39,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
47,00:04:23,2021-04-26 17:40:39,Parent,Yeah.

49,00:04:28,2021-04-26 17:40:44,Parent,Do you like to help your friends?
50,00:04:29,2021-04-26 17:40:45,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
51,00:04:31,2021-04-26 17:40:47,Parent,Do you like to help me and papa?
52,00:04:37,2021-04-26 17:40:53,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
53,00:04:37,2021-04-26 17:40:53,Parent,"Yeah. You're a pretty good one. Really, I'm still so impressed at how much you helped with the cranberries. She reaped the wheat and it was ready to be taken to the mill and made into flour. ""Who will help me carry the wheat to the mill?"" She asked. What do you think they said? ""Not I,"" (laughs) said The Duck. ""Not I,"" said The Goose. ""Not I,"" said The Cat. ""Not I,"" said The Pig. ""Then I will carry it myself."" Said The Little Red Hen. And she did. She carried the wheat to the mill and the miller made it into flour."
54,00:05:23,2021-04-26 17:41:39,Robot,"Sarah, what does miller mean?"
55,00:05:25,2021-04-26 17:41:41,Parent,(laughs)
56,00:05:25,2021-04-26 17:41:41,Child,I don't know.
57,00:05:28,2021-04-26 17:41:44,Parent,Do you know what it means?
58,00:05:31,2021-04-26 17:41:47,Child,No.
59,00:05:31,2021-04-26 17:41:47,Parent,"Miller- a miller is somebody who turns wheat into flour. Or other grains. And so they have a mill. We went- do you remember when we went to the plant- plantation? It was a while ago. But one way to grind flour- or, grains into flour is to put it between two big rocks and then turns and grinds it in little tiny bits."
60,00:05:57,2021-04-26 17:42:13,Child,Ah. Hm.
61,00:06:08,2021-04-26 17:42:24,Parent,"When she got it home, she asked, ""Who will make me the flo-"" Whoa. ""Who will help me make the flour into dough?"" That's something you're good at, right? No?"
62,00:06:22,2021-04-26 17:42:38,Child,They said no.
63,00:06:24,2021-04-26 17:42:40,Parent,"Oh. They said no. ""Not I,"" said The Duck. ""Not I,"" said The Goose. ""Not I,"" said The Cat. ""Not I,"" said The Pig."
64,00:06:35,2021-04-26 17:42:51,Child,"So, she did it herself."
65,00:06:38,2021-04-26 17:42:54,Parent,"""Then I will make the dough myself,"" Said The Little Red Hen. And she did. Soon the bread was ready to go into the oven. ""Who will help me bake the bread?"" Said The Little Red Hen."
66,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Parent,(silence)
67,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Parent,What'd they say?
68,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Child,"""Not I,"""
69,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Parent,Said The Duck.
70,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Child,"""Not I,"" said The Goose. ""Not I,"" said The Cat. ""Not I,"" Said The Pig. So she did- ""So I will do it myself,"""
71,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Parent,Said The Little Red Hen. And she did.
72,00:07:20,2021-04-26 17:43:36,Child,And she did.
73,00:07:23,2021-04-26 17:43:39,Parent,"After the loaf had been taken from the oven, it was set on the window sill to cool. ""And now,"" said The Little Red Hen, ""Who will help me eat the bread?"" (laughs)"
74,00:07:33,2021-04-26 17:43:49,Child,"""Not..."""
75,00:07:40,2021-04-26 17:43:56,Parent,"No one wants to eat the bread? (laughs) Or they do? Yeah. ""I will,"" said The Duck."
76,00:07:48,2021-04-26 17:44:04,Child,"""I will,"" said The Goose. ""I will,"" said The Cat. ""I will,"" said The Pig."
77,00:07:53,2021-04-26 17:44:09,Parent,(laughs)
78,00:07:53,2021-04-26 17:44:09,Child,"""I will eat it myself,"""
79,00:07:55,2021-04-26 17:44:11,Parent,Said The Little Red Hen. And she did.
80,00:08:05,2021-04-26 17:44:21,Child,Did.
81,00:08:09,2021-04-26 17:44:25,Parent,(laughs)
82,00:08:09,2021-04-26 17:44:25,Child,The end-
83,00:08:11,2021-04-26 17:44:27,Robot,"Hey, Louisa, why is The Hen eating by herself?"
84,00:08:15,2021-04-26 17:44:31,Child,Because no one else helped her.
85,00:08:15,2021-04-26 17:44:31,Parent,(laughs)
86,00:08:20,2021-04-26 17:44:36,Robot,Uh-huh. I agree.
87,00:08:27,2021-04-26 17:44:43,Parent,(laughs)

96,00:09:08,2021-04-26 17:45:24,Parent,"It's not working? Let's see, you can go to the first page. Maybe from here we can get back to the bookshelf?"
97,00:09:16,2021-04-26 17:45:32,Child,"No, no, no, no."
98,00:09:17,2021-04-26 17:45:33,Parent,"Nope, nope."

162,00:14:05,2021-04-26 17:50:21,Parent,I can't hear myself?
163,00:14:06,2021-04-26 17:50:22,Child,Okay [crosstalk 00:14:06]-
164,00:14:06,2021-04-26 17:50:22,Parent,"Well, if you cover my ears, that's the only thing I can hear. (laughs) Okay."
165,00:14:09,2021-04-26 17:50:25,Child,Okay.
166,00:14:09,2021-04-26 17:50:25,Parent,"Enough, enough."
167,00:14:09,2021-04-26 17:50:25,Child,Enough. Enough now?
168,00:14:09,2021-04-26 17:50:25,Parent,"Oh, no thank you. I don't want it on my face."
169,00:14:24,2021-04-26 17:50:40,Child,Yeah.
170,00:14:24,2021-04-26 17:50:40,Parent,No. Okay. I know. No. Okay. So Louisa-

173,00:14:35,2021-04-26 17:50:51,Child,(laughs)
174,00:14:39,2021-04-26 17:50:55,Parent,"(laughs) Yeah. If you wanna [inaudible 00:14:43]- if you wanna read another story, I'm gonna need ya- need you to-"
175,00:14:47,2021-04-26 17:51:03,Child,How did this break?
176,00:14:52,2021-04-26 17:51:08,Parent,What? I will await further instructions if things seem to be happening.
177,00:15:13,2021-04-26 17:51:29,Child,"Um, what is she doing?"
178,00:15:15,2021-04-26 17:51:31,Parent,"She's trying to get it, um, up and running again so we can read another story."
179,00:15:21,2021-04-26 17:51:37,Child,Boo.
180,00:15:23,2021-04-26 17:51:39,Parent,"Sit, please."
181,00:15:25,2021-04-26 17:51:41,Child,Boo iPad. Boo iPad.
182,00:15:30,2021-04-26 17:51:46,Parent,"No, it's not an iPad, so there's that."
183,00:15:35,2021-04-26 17:51:51,Child,But it's just an iPad connected to that.
184,00:15:36,2021-04-26 17:51:52,Parent,Okay. Connected.
185,00:15:39,2021-04-26 17:51:55,Child,Boo.
186,00:15:40,2021-04-26 17:51:56,Parent,"It's a tablet, but not an iPad. Move back, please."
187,00:15:41,2021-04-26 17:51:57,Child,iPad.
188,00:15:46,2021-04-26 17:52:02,Parent,(laughs)
189,00:15:46,2021-04-26 17:52:02,Child,What?
190,00:15:46,2021-04-26 17:52:02,Parent,It's still The Little Red Hen. (laughs) Oh.
191,00:15:47,2021-04-26 17:52:03,Parent,(silence)
192,00:15:47,2021-04-26 17:52:03,Child,My tummy.
193,00:16:09,2021-04-26 17:52:25,Parent,"Oh, it's [inaudible 00:16:09]. Tummy? Too much ice cream? Let's keep your... Hm."
194,00:16:21,2021-04-26 17:52:37,Child,Done. [inaudible 00:16:22].
195,00:16:21,2021-04-26 17:52:37,Parent,(laughs) Oh my gosh. (laughs) You're killing me [inaudible 00:16:57].
196,00:16:57,2021-04-26 17:53:13,Robot,"Louisa, is the tablet working now?"
197,00:17:00,2021-04-26 17:53:16,Child,Yes. Wha- what?
198,00:17:06,2021-04-26 17:53:22,Parent,I think we have a l-
199,00:17:06,2021-04-26 17:53:22,Robot,All right.
200,00:17:07,2021-04-26 17:53:23,Parent,... One of these [crosstalk 00:17:08].
201,00:17:07,2021-04-26 17:53:23,Robot,Thank you.
202,00:17:14,2021-04-26 17:53:30,Child,[crosstalk 00:17:14]-
203,00:17:14,2021-04-26 17:53:30,Parent,Geraldine The Music Mouse.
204,00:17:20,2021-04-26 17:53:36,Child,Is that a statue of Geraldine?
205,00:17:20,2021-04-26 17:53:36,Parent,It looks like. Do you remember what mouse book we have? 'Cause we had one of the- a book about this little mouse.
206,00:17:25,2021-04-26 17:53:41,Child,Yeah.
207,00:17:29,2021-04-26 17:53:45,Parent,When they're all planting like seeds and stuff for the winter. Is that the book we have?
208,00:17:34,2021-04-26 17:53:50,Child,"Um, yeah."
209,00:17:39,2021-04-26 17:53:55,Parent,"I don't remember where it is. Geraldine The Music Mouse. Geraldine had never heard music before. Noises, yes. Many noises. The voices of people, the slamming of doors, the barking of dogs, the rushing of water, the meow's of cats. [inaudible 00:17:57]. Of course, the soft peeping of mice. But music, never. Then one morning, in a pantry of the empty house where Geraldine lived, she discovered an enormous piece of Parmesan cheese. The largest she had ever seen."
210,00:18:18,2021-04-26 17:54:34,Child,Where? Where?
211,00:18:20,2021-04-26 17:54:36,Parent,What do you think is the cheese?
212,00:18:20,2021-04-26 17:54:36,Robot,"Louisa, can you point to the cheese?"
213,00:18:22,2021-04-26 17:54:38,Parent,(laughs) Which do you think is the cheese?
214,00:18:26,2021-04-26 17:54:42,Child,Hm...
215,00:18:32,2021-04-26 17:54:48,Parent,I think that might be right.
216,00:18:33,2021-04-26 17:54:49,Robot,I think so.
217,00:18:37,2021-04-26 17:54:53,Parent,"The largest she had ever seen. Eagerly, she took the little bite from it. It was delicious. But how would she be able to take it to her secret hideout in the barn? She ran to her friends who lived next door and told them about her discovery. ""If you help me carry it to my hideout,"" she said, ""I'll give each of you a big piece,"" Her friends, who loved cheese, happily agreed. ""Let's go,"" they said. And off they went. ""It's enormous!"" ""It's gigantic!"" ""It's immense!"" ""Its fantastic!"" They shouted with joy when they saw the piece of cheese. They pushed and pulled and tugged and finally they managed to carry it to Geraldine's hideout."
218,00:19:27,2021-04-26 17:55:43,Robot,"Hey, Louisa. What does gigantic mean?"
219,00:19:30,2021-04-26 17:55:46,Child,I don't know.
220,00:19:38,2021-04-26 17:55:54,Parent,What do you think it means?
221,00:19:41,2021-04-26 17:55:57,Child,Big.
222,00:19:45,2021-04-26 17:56:01,Robot,"Yeah, that's right."
223,00:19:49,2021-04-26 17:56:05,Parent,Otherwise knowns- known as gigantic? (laughs)
224,00:19:55,2021-04-26 17:56:11,Child,[inaudible 00:19:55].
225,00:19:58,2021-04-26 17:56:14,Parent,"There, Geraldine climbed to the very top of the cheese. She dug her little teeth into it and pulled away, crumb after crumb, chunk after chunk. As her friends carried away their cheese to bits, Geraldine peered in amazement at the hole she had gnawed. There she saw the shapes of two enormous ears. Cheese ears. (laughs) Do you have cheese ears? No."
226,00:20:30,2021-04-26 17:56:46,Child,Peach ears.
227,00:20:31,2021-04-26 17:56:47,Parent,Peach ears?
228,00:20:32,2021-04-26 17:56:48,Child,Mm.
229,00:20:36,2021-04-26 17:56:52,Parent,"As soon as her friends were gone again, she went back to work again nibbling away at the cheese as fast as she could. When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the form she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. What is it?"
230,00:21:00,2021-04-26 17:57:16,Child,Geraldine with a music.
231,00:21:03,2021-04-26 17:57:19,Parent,"Yeah. The ears were those of a giant mouse still partly hidden of solid cheese. To its puckered lips, it held a flute. Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered an entire mouse. Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue. With the dimming of the last daylight, she fell asleep. Suddenly, she was awakened from some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet."
232,00:21:51,2021-04-26 17:58:07,Robot,What do you think will happen to flute?
233,00:22:04,2021-04-26 17:58:20,Child,I don't know.
234,00:22:04,2021-04-26 17:58:20,Parent,"You don't know? I don't know either. As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. ""What was it?"" she thought. ""This must be music!"" She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty windowpanes. As the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped altogether. ""Play, play!"" Geraldine begged. Why did it stop?"
235,00:22:50,2021-04-26 17:59:06,Child,Because it wasn't right time and it was supposed to be a real statue alive that was made out of cheese and played a saxophone for its tail. [crosstalk 00:23:08]-
236,00:23:08,2021-04-26 17:59:24,Robot,You are right.
237,00:23:13,2021-04-26 17:59:29,Child,And didn't stop.
238,00:23:14,2021-04-26 17:59:30,Parent,And didn't stop?
239,00:23:16,2021-04-26 17:59:32,Child,Until the morning came.
240,00:23:16,2021-04-26 17:59:32,Parent,"Hm. ""Play some more!"" But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. Do you [inaudible 00:23:39]? Yeah? When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began fatefully at dusk and lasted until the break of day. And so night after night, the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, and even in daylight, they lingered in her ears."
241,00:24:01,2021-04-26 18:00:17,Robot,What does gobble mean?
242,00:24:02,2021-04-26 18:00:18,Child,Eat. Eat.
243,00:24:07,2021-04-26 18:00:23,Parent,Eat.
244,00:24:09,2021-04-26 18:00:25,Robot,Correct.
245,00:24:16,2021-04-26 18:00:32,Parent,"And one day, she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said, ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" ""But that is not possible!"" Ooh, see, look. [inaudible 00:24:32]."
246,00:24:35,2021-04-26 18:00:51,Child,Angry.
247,00:24:39,2021-04-26 18:00:55,Parent,Yeah. Why do you think they're angry?
248,00:24:40,2021-04-26 18:00:56,Child,Because they have no food.
249,00:24:47,2021-04-26 18:01:03,Parent,"Yeah. They must be hangry. (laughs) Geraldine shouted, ""Why?"" As- Or, oh. I see. ""But that is not possible!"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" Asked the others angrily. ""Because, because, because it is music!"" Her friends looked at Geraldine, surprised. ""What is music?"" They all asked together. They still are pretty mad. For a moment Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backward, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to her puckered lips, took a deep breath and blew."
250,00:25:23,2021-04-26 18:01:39,Child,(laughs)
251,00:25:28,2021-04-26 18:01:44,Parent,What do you think?
252,00:25:28,2021-04-26 18:01:44,Child,They're laughing.
253,00:25:28,2021-04-26 18:01:44,Parent,They're laughing? Why are they laughing?
254,00:25:34,2021-04-26 18:01:50,Child,Because it's so [inaudible 00:25:34].
255,00:25:34,2021-04-26 18:01:50,Parent,Do you think they hear music?
256,00:25:36,2021-04-26 18:01:52,Child,Mm-hmm (affirmative).
257,00:25:38,2021-04-26 18:01:54,Parent,"She blew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until her- their hungry little tummies hurt. Then, a long, soft beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath. [inaudible 00:26:02]? Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group, whispered, ""This is music Geraldine. You are right. We cannot eat that cheese."""
258,00:26:20,2021-04-26 18:02:36,Robot,Why did they say that listening to the music was a miracle?
259,00:26:27,2021-04-26 18:02:43,Child,Because it was nice.
260,00:26:29,2021-04-26 18:02:45,Parent,Because it was nice?
261,00:26:30,2021-04-26 18:02:46,Child,Because it was nice.
262,00:26:37,2021-04-26 18:02:53,Parent,"Hm. ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully. ""Now, we can eat the cheese because now the music is in me."" With that, they all followed Geraldine to the barn. And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese 'til their tummy's content. Do you like cheese [inaudible 00:27:04]? Yeah? The end."
263,00:27:10,2021-04-26 18:03:26,Child,Oh.
264,00:27:17,2021-04-26 18:03:33,Parent,"Go back? And going to bookshelf, there we go."
265,00:27:27,2021-04-26 18:03:43,Child,I bet it's [inaudible 00:27:27].
266,00:27:27,2021-04-26 18:03:43,Robot,That was a great story. What was the favorite part?
267,00:27:29,2021-04-26 18:03:45,Child,"Um, the music that the mouse played on the statue."
268,00:27:38,2021-04-26 18:03:54,Robot,Music.
269,00:27:40,2021-04-26 18:03:56,Parent,When she was playing music on top of the statue?
270,00:27:43,2021-04-26 18:03:59,Child,No.
271,00:27:44,2021-04-26 18:04:00,Robot,Yeah. Me too.
272,00:27:45,2021-04-26 18:04:01,Child,When the statue playing music.
273,00:27:46,2021-04-26 18:04:02,Parent,"Oh, the statue playing music was your favorite part."
274,00:27:52,2021-04-26 18:04:08,Child,Now-
275,00:27:52,2021-04-26 18:04:08,Robot,Nice.
276,00:27:52,2021-04-26 18:04:08,Robot,(silence)
