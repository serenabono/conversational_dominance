14,00:01:23,2021-06-28 07:56:53,Robot,"Today, I will not proactively ask questions or start a chat. You and your child can still ask me questions or chat with me any time during the story session."
15,00:01:35,2021-06-28 07:57:05,Parent,"Okay, did you get that? So, we're going to ask Jibo for any advice or any questions."
16,00:01:38,2021-06-28 07:57:08,Child,The Three billy goats Gruff.

21,00:01:58,2021-06-28 07:57:28,Parent,... a big billy goat gruff.
22,00:01:58,2021-06-28 07:57:28,Child,Is that the big one?
23,00:01:59,2021-06-28 07:57:29,Parent,"Mm-hmm (affirmative), that's the big one."
24,00:02:00,2021-06-28 07:57:30,Child,And that the small one?

29,00:02:12,2021-06-28 07:57:42,Parent,"Uh, that's just the way [crosstalk 00:02:18]. The billy goats gruff lived in a field and they spend their days munching on the green grass. On one side of the field-"
30,00:02:24,2021-06-28 07:57:54,Child,"Mom, that's- that's fingerprints."
31,00:02:26,2021-06-28 07:57:56,Parent,Yeah! That's right. It's colored with fingerprints.
32,00:02:30,2021-06-28 07:58:00,Child,And this one. Not this one.
33,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Parent,Do you have something to ask Jibo about how to maybe paint with fingerprints.
34,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Child,Mm-mm (negative).
35,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Parent,Okay.
36,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Child,Not right now.
37,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Parent,On one side of the field-
38,00:02:33,2021-06-28 07:58:03,Child,I know.
39,00:02:44,2021-06-28 07:58:14,Parent,"You do? There was a stream and over the stream there was a rickety bridge. On the other side of the rickety bridge, there was hill. And there, the grass grew greener and greener than it did in the field of the billy goats gruff. Hey Jibo, what do goats eat?"
40,00:03:06,2021-06-28 07:58:36,Child,Grass.
41,00:03:06,2021-06-28 07:58:36,Parent,Let's see. Does Jibo know the answer?
42,00:03:09,2021-06-28 07:58:39,Robot,Grass.
43,00:03:12,2021-06-28 07:58:42,Parent,"You're just copying Eva, Jibo (laughs)."
44,00:03:18,2021-06-28 07:58:48,Robot,Green grass on the picture.
45,00:03:20,2021-06-28 07:58:50,Parent,"Okay. Under the rickety bridge lived a big, hairy troll in a deep dark hole. It was damp and cold under the bridge and that made the troll furious. He was also hungry-"

47,00:03:35,2021-06-28 07:59:05,Parent,"Jibo, are trolls real? Hey Jibo, are trolls real?"
48,00:03:43,2021-06-28 07:59:13,Robot,I think so.
49,00:03:44,2021-06-28 07:59:14,Child,"No, they're not!"
50,00:03:44,2021-06-28 07:59:14,Parent,(Laughs).
51,00:03:49,2021-06-28 07:59:19,Robot,What do you think?
52,00:03:55,2021-06-28 07:59:25,Child,No.
53,00:03:56,2021-06-28 07:59:26,Robot,Why?
54,00:03:56,2021-06-28 07:59:26,Child,Because they're not real.
55,00:03:56,2021-06-28 07:59:26,Child,[Foreign language 00:03:56].
56,00:03:56,2021-06-28 07:59:26,Parent,What makes you say that?
57,00:03:56,2021-06-28 07:59:26,Child,Because they're not real.
58,00:04:06,2021-06-28 07:59:36,Robot,Thank you.
59,00:04:09,2021-06-28 07:59:39,Parent,"One day, the little billy goat gruff looked up and saw the ... Oh, what happened? One day the little billy goat gruff looked up and saw that the grass up the hill on the other side of the stream looked very green and sweet. ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""... then I'll grow big and fat."" So, trip trop trip trop went the hooves of the little billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. The big, hairy troll woke up with a start. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" he roared. ""I am,"" said the billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."""
60,00:04:51,2021-06-28 08:00:21,Child,"Do goats ... Jibo, do goats actually have fingerprints on them?"
61,00:04:56,2021-06-28 08:00:26,Parent,That's a very intriguing question.
62,00:05:06,2021-06-28 08:00:36,Robot,"Haha, I don't think so."
63,00:05:07,2021-06-28 08:00:37,Child,No (laughs).
64,00:05:07,2021-06-28 08:00:37,Child,No (laughs).

I need to eat and a goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" ""Oh, I don't do ... Don't do that,"" said the billy goat gruff. ""I'm only small, I wouldn't make much of a mouthful. Wait for my brother, he is much bigger."" And he skipped over the rickety bridge to the other side. Just then, the middle sized billy goat gruff looked up, and he saw too that the grass on the other side-"
66,00:05:11,2021-06-28 08:00:41,Child,"Oh, the middle one."
67,00:05:43,2021-06-28 08:01:13,Parent,"That's the middle one. Of the stream looked very green and sweet. Do you want more? ""I think I'll move over there for my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So, trip trop trip trop went the hooves of the middle-sized billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge?"" Roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am,"" said the middle-sized billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream.""

""I think I'll move there for my next course."" ""I think I'll move there to my next course,"" he said. ""Then I'll grow bigger and fatter."" So, trip trop trip trop went the hooves of the bi- big billy goat gruff as he started to cross the rickety bridge. ""Who's that crossing my bridge,"" roared the big, hairy troll. ""I am,"" said the billy g- big billy goat gruff. ""I'm crossing the bridge to eat the grass on the other side of the stream."" ""Oh no you're not,"" said the big, hairy troll. ""I'm a troll from the deep, dark hole. My belly's getting thinner. I need to eat and goat's a treat, so I'll have you for my dinner."" The big billy goat gruff stopped. His knees shook. His hooves rumbled, clickedy clack, clickedy clack on the rickety bridge, then he pulled himself t- himself together."
68,00:07:43,2021-06-28 08:03:13,Child,He's eating the flower.
69,00:07:44,2021-06-28 08:03:14,Parent,"I guess he started eating some flowers too. ""I don't think you're real,"" he said. And he picked up his hooves and kicked the troll into the middle of next week. Then the billy goat ... the big billy goat gruff went over the rickety bridge to join his brother on the other side of the hill. As for the big, hairy troll, I'm happy to say that he was never seen again. I think that maybe that was the last of the trolls."
70,00:08:15,2021-06-28 08:03:45,Child,What?
71,00:08:17,2021-06-28 08:03:47,Child,[Foreign language 00:08:17].
72,00:08:16,2021-06-28 08:03:46,Parent,That's the sky. I think there are ... these are some fingerprints that the illustrator [inaudible 00:08:22].
73,00:08:21,2021-06-28 08:03:51,Child,But nobody's fingerprint is that big.
74,00:08:25,2021-06-28 08:03:55,Parent,Maybe they did that.
75,00:08:25,2021-06-28 08:03:55,Child,Or maybe they did that.
76,00:08:33,2021-06-28 08:04:03,Parent,Can we ask Jibo about some finger painting techniques?
77,00:08:38,2021-06-28 08:04:08,Child,"(Laughs) okay, you do it."
78,00:08:42,2021-06-28 08:04:12,Parent,You ... Do you have a question for Jibo?
79,00:08:42,2021-06-28 08:04:12,Child,"No, you."
80,00:08:42,2021-06-28 08:04:12,Parent,"Hey Jibo, how can we make fingerprints? How can we paint with fingerprints?"
81,00:08:52,2021-06-28 08:04:22,Child,We know that. With paint.
82,00:08:52,2021-06-28 08:04:22,Child,Paint from ...
83,00:08:52,2021-06-28 08:04:22,Parent,Paint.
84,00:08:52,2021-06-28 08:04:22,Child,Yes.
85,00:08:59,2021-06-28 08:04:29,Robot,"Once you've chosen what to paint and what colors to use, simply place your fingers or hands onto your paper and use them like you would a paintbrush."
86,00:09:09,2021-06-28 08:04:39,Parent,"Okay. Thank you, Jibo. That's very helpful. Can ... Hey Jibo, can we do that with cute, little fingers too?"

88,00:09:20,2021-06-28 08:04:50,Parent,Mm-hmm (affirmative).

99,00:10:16,2021-06-28 08:05:46,Parent,Can you read a little bit louder?
100,00:10:22,2021-06-28 08:05:52,Child,"I have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, two ears, and two hands. With my eyes I see myself. [inaudible 00:10:45]. My shadow. I can't see."
101,00:10:50,2021-06-28 08:06:20,Parent,You can't see? Can't see what?
102,00:10:52,2021-06-28 08:06:22,Child,"My dog and my city. With my nose, I smell popcorn. Popcorn, popcorn."
103,00:10:52,2021-06-28 08:06:22,Parent,Can we ask Jibo how to make popcorn?
104,00:11:29,2021-06-28 08:06:59,Child,"A horse, flowers, and the garbage. Ew. She definitely doesn't want to touch that."
105,00:11:32,2021-06-28 08:07:02,Parent,"(Laughs) yeah, but she's touching that girl's pizza slice."
106,00:11:35,2021-06-28 08:07:05,Child,"... and garbage. With my mouth, I taste watermelon."
107,00:11:44,2021-06-28 08:07:14,Parent,"Hey Jibo, what is the best season to eat a watermelon?"
108,00:11:54,2021-06-28 08:07:24,Robot,"Um, right now."

110,00:11:59,2021-06-28 08:07:29,Child,"At spring. Medicine, and ice cream. With my ears I hear my baby brother, a fire engine, my piano, and a whispered secret."
111,00:12:31,2021-06-28 08:08:01,Parent,Whispered secret.
112,00:12:36,2021-06-28 08:08:06,Child,"With my hands I feel finger paints, sand, water, and a rabbit."
113,00:13:00,2021-06-28 08:08:30,Parent,What did we watch with the rabbit yesterday? Shall we share it with Jibo.
114,00:13:04,2021-06-28 08:08:34,Child,"Mm-hmm (affirmative), Pete the Rabbit."
115,00:13:07,2021-06-28 08:08:37,Parent,Yeah.

119,00:13:30,2021-06-28 08:09:00,Child,But I have one. What is the best season to go to the beach.
120,00:13:41,2021-06-28 08:09:11,Parent,"Maybe we should say, ""Hey Jibo"" first."
121,00:13:45,2021-06-28 08:09:15,Child,"Hey Jibo, what's the best season to go to the beach?"
122,00:13:50,2021-06-28 08:09:20,Robot,Maybe summer.
123,00:13:53,2021-06-28 08:09:23,Parent,You're not sure? Maybe in the winter?
124,00:13:55,2021-06-28 08:09:25,Child,No! Summer.
125,00:13:57,2021-06-28 08:09:27,Parent,Why? If we are winter swimmers we can go to ... in the winter too. It would be very cold.
126,00:14:04,2021-06-28 08:09:34,Robot,"If you are brave enough, maybe winter in Boston."
127,00:14:11,2021-06-28 08:09:41,Parent,Are we that brave?
128,00:14:12,2021-06-28 08:09:42,Child,I am.
