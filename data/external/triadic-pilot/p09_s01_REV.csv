When she was halfway through, Geraldine climbed down to have a look at the forms she had freed. She could hardly believe what she saw. What did, what does she see?"

Geraldine gnawed and gnawed until she had finally uncovered the entire mouse. Do you know what the word puckered means? Puckered lips?"
153,00:12:33,2021-06-07 18:40:49,Child,[inaudible 00:12:33]?
154,00:12:34,2021-06-07 18:40:50,Parent,"So it said, to it's puckered lips. I want you to look. Do you see that picture here?"
155,00:12:39,2021-06-07 18:40:55,Child,"Uh, yeah."
156,00:12:41,2021-06-07 18:40:57,Parent,"So when you're playing the flute, you might have puckered lips. Right where they stick out, yeah. That... Right? Then she realized that the flute was really the tip of the mouse's tail. Astonished, exhausted and a little frightened, Geraldine stared at the cheese statue with the dimming of the last daylight. She fell..."
157,00:13:04,2021-06-07 18:41:20,Child,Asleep.
158,00:13:05,2021-06-07 18:41:21,Parent,Why did she fall asleep?
159,00:13:09,2021-06-07 18:41:25,Child,'Cause she [inaudible 00:13:09].
160,00:13:08,2021-06-07 18:41:24,Parent,Yeah. Suddenly she was awakened by some strange sounds. They seemed to come from the direction of the mouse's flute. She jumped to her feet.
161,00:13:24,2021-06-07 18:41:40,Child,Oh.
162,00:13:24,2021-06-07 18:41:40,Parent,Want to see what happens next?
163,00:13:25,2021-06-07 18:41:41,Child,Yeah. Turn the page. Turn the page.
164,00:13:28,2021-06-07 18:41:44,Parent,"As it grew darker, the sounds became clearer and more melodious until they seemed to move lightly through the air like invisible strings of silver and gold. Never had Geraldine heard anything so beautiful. Music, she thought. What do you think melodious means? That's kind of a big word."
165,00:13:28,2021-06-07 18:41:44,Child,Beautiful?
166,00:13:51,2021-06-07 18:42:07,Parent,"Close. It's, it's... [inaudible 00:13:53] the word melody, which is a song, the main part of a song. (laughs). This must be music. She listened all through the night until the first glow of dawn filtered through the dusty windowpanes."
167,00:14:10,2021-06-07 18:42:26,Robot,I like cheese statue. Can we start a discussion about cheese statue?
168,00:14:15,2021-06-07 18:42:31,Child,No.
169,00:14:16,2021-06-07 18:42:32,Parent,You don't wanna talk about the cheese statue?
170,00:14:25,2021-06-07 18:42:41,Child,No.
171,00:14:25,2021-06-07 18:42:41,Parent,You don't wanna talk about it?
172,00:14:25,2021-06-07 18:42:41,Child,Maybe.
173,00:14:25,2021-06-07 18:42:41,Parent,"Say, we can talk about it."
174,00:14:25,2021-06-07 18:42:41,Child,Maybe talk about it later.
175,00:14:28,2021-06-07 18:42:44,Parent,Do you wanna talk about it at the end of the book?
176,00:14:29,2021-06-07 18:42:45,Child,Yeah.
177,00:14:30,2021-06-07 18:42:46,Parent,"Say, can we have a discussion..."
178,00:14:32,2021-06-07 18:42:48,Child,Can we have a discussion at the end of the book? So that's a yes.
179,00:14:40,2021-06-07 18:42:56,Parent,"But as the cheese mouse was slowly bathed in light, the music became softer until it stopped all together. ""Play, play,"" Geraldine begged."
180,00:14:51,2021-06-07 18:43:07,Child,[inaudible 00:14:51] at night. Only at night.
181,00:14:50,2021-06-07 18:43:06,Parent,"Oh, yeah. Play some more. But not a sound came from the flute. ""Will it ever play again?"" Geraldine thought as she gobbled up some of the crumbs that lay around. When the next evening approached, it brought the answer to her question. The music began faintly at dusk and lasted until the break of day, until night after night the cheese flutist played for Geraldine. She learned to recognize the melodies, the main parts of the music."
182,00:14:50,2021-06-07 18:43:06,Child,Songs.
183,00:15:27,2021-06-07 18:43:43,Parent,"Yeah, the songs. Exactly. And even in daylight they lingered in her ears. What do you think lingered means? Something lingers in her ears."
184,00:15:36,2021-06-07 18:43:52,Child,Stick.
185,00:15:38,2021-06-07 18:43:54,Parent,Kinda stays?
186,00:15:39,2021-06-07 18:43:55,Child,Yeah.
187,00:15:40,2021-06-07 18:43:56,Parent,"Yeah. Then one day she met her friends on the street. They were desperate. ""Geraldine,"" they said. ""We have no more food and there is none to be found anywhere. You must share your cheese with us."" Look at how hungry they are. That's one, two, three, four, five, six. Six very hungry mice. ""But that is not possible,"" Geraldine shouted. ""Why?"" asked the others eagerly. ""Because, because, because, it is music."" Her friends looked at Geraldine surprised. ""What is music?"" they asked altogether. So do you think they'd heard music before?"
188,00:16:16,2021-06-07 18:44:32,Child,No.
189,00:16:19,2021-06-07 18:44:35,Parent,"For a moment Geraldine stood deep in thought. Then she took a step backwards, solemnly lifted the tip of her tail to puckered lips, took a deep breath and-"
190,00:16:29,2021-06-07 18:44:45,Child,Blew.
191,00:16:29,2021-06-07 18:44:45,Parent,"... blew. She slew hard. She puffed, she peeped, she tweeted, she screeched. Her friends laughed until their hungry little tummies hurt. So is she making music on her tail?"
192,00:16:46,2021-06-07 18:45:02,Child,No.
193,00:16:46,2021-06-07 18:45:02,Parent,And what are they doing?
194,00:16:47,2021-06-07 18:45:03,Child,Laughing [inaudible 00:16:47].
195,00:16:50,2021-06-07 18:45:06,Parent,"Then a long soft beautiful whistle came from Geraldine's lips. One of the melodies of the cheese flute echoed in the air. The little mice held their breath in amazement. Look, [inaudible 00:17:02]. Other mice came to hear the miracle. When the tune came to an end, Gregory, the oldest of the group whispered, ""If this is music, Geraldine, you are right. We cannot eat that cheese."" ""No,"" said Geraldine joyfully."
196,00:17:16,2021-06-07 18:45:32,Robot,"Luke, I think it's a good time for you to ask us a question."
197,00:17:16,2021-06-07 18:45:32,Child,Why?
198,00:17:24,2021-06-07 18:45:40,Parent,Do you wanna ask a question about the story?
199,00:17:24,2021-06-07 18:45:40,Child,No.
200,00:17:29,2021-06-07 18:45:45,Parent,No. No question today?
201,00:17:30,2021-06-07 18:45:46,Child,No.
202,00:17:31,2021-06-07 18:45:47,Parent,"Say, no thanks."
203,00:17:32,2021-06-07 18:45:48,Child,"No thanks, Jibo."
204,00:17:34,2021-06-07 18:45:50,Robot,"Okay, maybe next time."
205,00:17:38,2021-06-07 18:45:54,Child,[inaudible 00:17:38].
206,00:17:38,2021-06-07 18:45:54,Parent,Now we can eat the cheese because now the music in me. With that they all followed Geraldine to the barn. So what's gonna happen?
207,00:17:45,2021-06-07 18:46:01,Child,They're gonna eat the cheese.
208,00:17:48,2021-06-07 18:46:04,Parent,Do you wanna ask Jibo a question about that?
209,00:17:50,2021-06-07 18:46:06,Child,"Jibo, why aren't they gonna keep the cheese they... so it can keep playing music at night?"
210,00:18:01,2021-06-07 18:46:17,Robot,Who can make music now?
211,00:18:01,2021-06-07 18:46:17,Child,Geraldine.
212,00:18:10,2021-06-07 18:46:26,Parent,"Geraldine, right?"
213,00:18:10,2021-06-07 18:46:26,Child,Yeah. [inaudible 00:18:17].
214,00:18:18,2021-06-07 18:46:34,Parent,(laughs). And while Gerald-
215,00:18:20,2021-06-07 18:46:36,Robot,That is why they can eat the cheese now?
216,00:18:23,2021-06-07 18:46:39,Child,[inaudible 00:18:23].
217,00:18:23,2021-06-07 18:46:39,Parent,I don't think so.
218,00:18:24,2021-06-07 18:46:40,Child,"Yes, you did."
219,00:18:25,2021-06-07 18:46:41,Parent,It just... And while Geraldine... Should we... Do you wanna keep talking to Jibo?
220,00:18:29,2021-06-07 18:46:45,Child,No.

222,00:18:30,2021-06-07 18:46:46,Child,Keep reading.
223,00:18:31,2021-06-07 18:46:47,Parent,"Say, Jibo, we're gonna read the story some more."
224,00:18:33,2021-06-07 18:46:49,Child,"Jibo, we're gonna read the story some more."
225,00:18:41,2021-06-07 18:46:57,Parent,"And while Geraldine whistled the gayest of tunes, they ate cheese to their tummy's content. The end."
226,00:18:50,2021-06-07 18:47:06,Child,Click first page. Enough.

230,00:19:02,2021-06-07 18:47:18,Child,"Jibo, the story is over. We're gonna have our discussion now."
231,00:19:02,2021-06-07 18:47:18,Robot,Awesome.
