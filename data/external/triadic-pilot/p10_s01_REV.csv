62,00:07:26,2021-06-08 19:34:29,Parent,"Now the third little pig met a man which a load of bricks. ""These bricks will make a fine, sturdy house,"" said the man. ""Capital idea, my good fellow,"" said the little pig."
63,00:07:42,2021-06-08 19:34:45,Child,"Wait, pigs can talk? That explains why, that's is, that is, that explains why I was talking like a human. I'm still pooping my pants.

65,00:08:04,2021-06-08 19:35:07,Child,[inaudible 00:08:04].
66,00:08:06,2021-06-08 19:35:09,Parent,"So he bought the bricks and set about building a house. It took him quite a bit of time, but it was well worth it."
67,00:08:10,2021-06-08 19:35:13,Child,"Yeah, 'cause that was a lot of bricks."
68,00:08:15,2021-06-08 19:35:18,Parent,"""Nice and solid,"" said the little pig. ""Nice and solid."""
69,00:08:17,2021-06-08 19:35:20,Child,Oh. He's putting the brick right there. Beep boo bop bop beep.
70,00:08:28,2021-06-08 19:35:31,Parent,"But no sooner had the little pig moved in than he noticed the wolf loitering about. And the wolf, who was still hungry, said, ""Little pig, little pig, let me come in."" To which the little pig replied, ""No, no, no. Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin."""
71,00:08:44,2021-06-08 19:35:47,Robot,"Alex, what did the wolf want to do to this little pig?"

So the wolf tried to blow the house down but since it was made of bricks it, the wind wasn't strong enough because the bricks were made of fabric."
75,00:09:20,2021-06-08 19:36:23,Parent,You think that's what's gonna happen?
76,00:09:22,2021-06-08 19:36:25,Child,Yes. I've seen this story before.
77,00:09:25,2021-06-08 19:36:28,Parent,"[inaudible 00:09:25]. Well, the wolf had heard that before. And he said, ""Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in."""

81,00:09:45,2021-06-08 19:36:48,Parent,But the wolf huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed until he was quite blue in the face.
82,00:09:50,2021-06-08 19:36:53,Child,"W- w- wait. Wait, both of them are the same page, I mean the same picture. See?"
83,00:10:04,2021-06-08 19:37:07,Parent,"You're right, it is the same picture. The house stood form. ""I'll try another approach,"" muttered the wolf."
84,00:10:12,2021-06-08 19:37:15,Robot,"When you mutter, how do you feel?"
85,00:10:16,2021-06-08 19:37:19,Child,[inaudible 00:10:16].

88,00:10:26,2021-06-08 19:37:29,Parent,"Do you know what the word ""mutter"" means? Mutter means to say sort of quietly and under your breath. And generally you're not happy."
89,00:10:46,2021-06-08 19:37:49,Robot,[inaudible 00:10:46] the wolf's face. His eyes look small and his eyebrows are pointing downward. What does mutter mean?
90,00:10:51,2021-06-08 19:37:54,Child,"I- i- well, literally, literally, literally angry."
91,00:10:57,2021-06-08 19:38:00,Robot,Awesome.

108,00:13:11,2021-06-08 19:40:14,Child,Be- be- because he wanted to eat that pig. Piggy.
109,00:13:11,2021-06-08 19:40:14,Robot,Nice. Terrific.
110,00:13:24,2021-06-08 19:40:27,Parent,"Next morning the little pig was up at four and went off for the apples. It took longer than he'd expect, expected to reach Merry Meadow. And while busy gathering apples in the highest tree he saw the apple, or the, yeah, the wolf approaching. ""Do try one of these,"" he called down, throwing an apple as far as he could. When the wolf chased after the apple, the little pig shimmied down the tree and made it safely home."
