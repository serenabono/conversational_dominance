S02,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.4,"[MOD]: Ok so thanks for coming today. we're going to play a quiz. I would n [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: I'm going to ask you three questions and I would li [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: ke you to to that were posed to group of one hundred pend one hundred people and then I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. [SPK2]: Ok [MOD]: and then we'll ask you to identify the ranking in terms of popularity. For example if I ask you what is normally used to to transport patients in a hospital you could say th things like ambulance, a wheelchair right? A patient's bed so is that is that clear? Do you have any ques [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: tions? Nope? Ok. [MOD]: Are you ready for the first question? [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: I have yeah I have to point out that you really need to talk to each other before you make your final decisions so you nee [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: d to have a discussion, ok? [SPK1]: Right. [MOD]: Right. So the first question i s where in which public place would you be more likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: A flu bag? [MOD]: A flu bug Sorry I'm not pronouncing [SPK2]: Oh bug ok. [MOD]: Bug [SPK2]: Sorry . [MOD]: sorry. [SPK1]: Which pu [SPK2]: Hm. [MOD]: Ex [SPK1]: blic place [MOD]: Yes. [SPK2]: ok Ok. [SPK1]: A doct [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: or's waiting room is that public? [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I guess it is yeah so that makes sense somewhere where there's just a lot of people and possibly outdoors so something like a park. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: Or a public school would they count? Are they kind of indoors? [SPK2]: Yeah actually I think a school would be better again it's real [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: close together and stuff. [SPK1]: Good. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: and I'm just thinking I've a friend who got sick lately [SPK2]: after working in a restaurant but I don't think people generally get sick in restaurants. [SPK1]: Well Depends on the kind [SPK2]: [SPK1]: of restaurant [MOD]: [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Yeah that's kinda tricky how you should it [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: As is is there are there any parameters going from it like does it have to be an open public pla ce or [MOD]: Not really. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: what like [SPK1]: Maybe [SPK2]: a swimming pool be a weird answer or would it make sense? [SPK1]: Would that make infections and things like that for the m like [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: funguses and toe things and Awful stuff like that. [SPK2]: Yeah exactly. [SPK1]: Yeah that was tricky. I I'd say school because everyone is always getting sick at school. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Or anywhere you're working in close proximity to someone. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: But [SPK2]: Me too though I think the doctor's waiting room is a pretty good one [SPK2]: and then a school and then [SPK1]: Ah yeah [SPK2]: like a a bus like public transport. [SPK1]: Awh yeah Sorry I I just touched a bus on the way here and it was so slimy it was gross yeah [SPK2]: Gross [SPK1]: So a bus would be a good one. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Alright. [SPK2]: Ok we say that that's a good three [SPK1]: fair enough [SPK2]: in that case? [SPK1]: ok which is the most popular though? [SPK2]: I think [MOD]: Before you can I [SPK1]: Oh [MOD]: give you my feedback? Before [SPK1]: Yes [MOD]: you decide [SPK1]: absolutely [MOD]: do you know about the ranking very good you have the two right? So it's the [SPK1]: [MOD]: school [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: and then it's the next one you mentioned the doctor's waiting room can you mention something similar? [MOD]: [SPK1]: Like a hospital waiting room [MOD]: Exactly. Great. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So a hospital is the second one and [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: the third one again well done it's a means of trans port but it's not the b b the bus it's [MOD]: a different mean [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: s of transport [SPK2]: Is it [SPK2]: Is it still public transport? [MOD]: We ll it's a means of transportation yes it i righ it is I suppose. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: [SPK2]: Are these people asked in Ireland or [SPK1]: exactly would it be the luas or [SPK2]: would it be New Yorkers saying the subway or something you know [MOD]: No it's not the subway. [SPK2]: ok [SPK2]: [SPK2]: The [SPK1]: I don't know I think it's like the bus the luas the dart [SPK2]: Yeah the train [MOD]: You're ge [SPK1]: the luas [MOD]: tting there you're very close [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: taxis like Dublin bikes cause I don't know [SPK2]: [MOD]: Yeah but what is [SPK2]: I don't [MOD]: the one thing that Irish people love to do How [SPK1]: Complain? [MOD]: do they travel [SPK1]: Oh sorry [SPK2]: that [SPK1]: was under there [MOD]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: one of our own cars walking [SPK1]: not walking [SPK2]: it makes sen nse to say in your own car though [SPK1]: That's not public [SPK2]: but it's a public place [MOD]: When people love to escape for fo from Ireland right they want [SPK1]: Oh pla ane of course the recycled [SPK2]: Oh plane [MOD]: Excellent [SPK1]: air! and [SPK2]: Ye ah [SPK1]: Jesus [MOD]: Well done [SPK1]: So hard [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Took us long enough. [MOD]: Now that you have the three most pop ular answers would you be able to discuss the ranking then? [SPK1]: Oh god ! [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: I suppose by population the number of people that travel on planes as opposed to the people that go to school or [SPK2]: Yeah exact I think that plane might [SPK1]: doctor's waiting room [SPK2]: be the third one because it's people who like travel all the time being like oh I hate travelling getting sick on the plane [SPK1]: La di daw [SPK2]: [SPK1]: What about doctor's waiting room or hospital waiting rooms? because you're already kinda [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: sick in there. [SPK2]: Yeah exactly like where does [SPK2]: So if this is like understanding what people said [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: like your mind went to waiting room before it went [SPK1]: ah well [SPK2]: to [SPK1]: ugh it's just the super bugs and stuff yeah [SPK2]: schools yeah [SPK2]: so [SPK1]: [SPK2]: and ag gain if you seen that this is adults talking more adults have probably been to a hospital or whatever lately than [SPK1]: I [SPK2]: to a school so [SPK1]: You did tell us the order there though didn't you? [MOD]: I will give you the order at the e nd [SPK2]: [MOD]: If [SPK1]: Yeah [MOD]: you can make your final decision then I can give you mine feedback yeah. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So what do you [SPK1]: I [MOD]: think [SPK1]: I remember you you just said it like five seconds ago and I don't remember it now [SPK2]: [SPK1]: You did the did you just say [SPK2]: I think she was just saying what they were. She didn't give the order [SPK1]: Oh I thought you said this I thought you said the third one was and the second one was but maybe it wasn't the order ok. [MOD]: No no it wasn't [SPK2]: [MOD]: the order [SPK1]: I was like darn I missed the answers [SPK2]: She was just saying what they were [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: Not giving you any hints now [SPK1]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Ok so would you say [SPK1]: hos [SPK2]: I would poss ibly go hospital and then school and then plane. [SPK1]: and then plane. Grand. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Is that your final decision yep? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Final answer. [MOD]: ok now the first option is actually the school [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: You mentioned adults there but don't forget that adults have families and they have kids. [SPK2]: They do. [MOD]: So s [SPK2]: Yeah [MOD]: The school is number one hospital is number two and the airplane is number three. But [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: Great, good job, very good. [MOD]: Are you ready for the second question now? [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: Great. [SPK1]: [MOD]: So I would like you to think about instruments what are the most popular answers to name the question of naming an instrument in an in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Oh ah just name? [SPK2]: Just an orchestra. [MOD]: In a symphony orchestra [SPK2]: [MOD]: or what are the instruments [SPK1]: Violins [SPK2]: so violin yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: most popular one [MOD]: [SPK1]: I don't cello based o based all the other strings flutes [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I don't know a symphony orchestra. I'm terrible at those. It's just a mini orchestra [SPK2]: There was a map of [SPK2]: all the things in a symphony ochestra in my school and I'm trying to think of it [SPK1]: [SPK2]: now. [MOD]: Well you've already got the two. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Oh oh there you go. so what do I say? [MOD]: So [SPK2]: Violins and cellos is it? [MOD]: Exactly. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK1]: as are there symbols and are those things that crash [SPK2]: [SPK1]: together? [SPK2]: Basically like a symbol or a drum or something [SPK1]: Yeah. What are those yolks called [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: with the monkeys [MOD]: You did find the third one [SPK2]: The drum? [MOD]: Yes! Exactly. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Well done. [SPK2]: Cool. [SPK1]: There you go. [MOD]: You're very good. So [SPK2]: [MOD]: What with the right or the ranking in terms of popularity. [SPK2]: ok I think violin would be number one [SPK1]: Yeah we both came to it first [SPK2]: in a big way. [SPK1]: to it first. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Then it's cellos? [SPK1]: or drums maybe. [SPK2]: I don't know I think that was or I don't know the kinda default thing that you think of with the symphony orchestra is like duh duh duh duh duh you know that starts with like the start of [SPK1]: [SPK2]: universal [SPK1]: Yeah [SPK2]: movies you know the dun dun dun dun dun. [SPK1]: oh so the drums? [SPK2]: so people might go to drums [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: then second I don't [SPK1]: [SPK2]: know it's just a way of thinking of it [SPK1]: maybe [SPK2]: yeah. [SPK1]: We go with that then? [SPK1]: the violin, drums, cello [SPK1]: Ok [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Think so. [MOD]: mhmm Ok? [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: you were very fast when you had to find the three answers but I'm afraid you again don't have the right ranking. [SPK2]: [MOD]: It was the violin then the cello. [SPK1]: oh [MOD]: and the drum was the third [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: last one but good great work. [SPK1]: well we're [MOD]: good job [SPK1]: getting there [SPK2]: Yeah [MOD]: I think the third question should be very simple. So I would like you to name things that people cut. [SPK1]: Cut? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: My god their hair. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Cucumbers. [SPK2]: Vege [SPK1]: tables [SPK2]: [MOD]: You have the hair. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Alright. [SPK2]: Paper? [MOD]: That's one. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Wrapping paper or [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK2]: something [MOD]: That's the second one. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: calorie [SPK1]: s nowadays [SPK2]: [SPK1]: no? carbs [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: [SPK2]: interest ing interpretation [SPK1]: hu I know [SPK2]: of the word cut. [SPK1]: what am I saying [SPK2]: about myself [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Sellotape? [SPK1]: Would you [SPK2]: Is it [SPK1]: or would you break sellotape with those little snazzy some people [SPK2]: things they have nowadays [SPK1]: some people [SPK2]: god are classic they go with the scissors [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: technologies really [SPK1]: screwed us [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: You did mention [SPK2]: cheese [MOD]: vegetables Would you [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: not think of a different cate gory of food [SPK1]: fruit [SPK2]: cheese [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: so specific [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: bread [SPK1]: meat, butcher [MOD]: Yes excellent [SPK2]: [MOD]: meat. [SPK2]: but I'm a vegetarian I'd never have thought of that [SPK1]: oh well that's not gonna [MOD]: Alright. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So what would be the ranking then? [SPK1]: Oh what was the third one paper [MOD]: hair [SPK1]: hair oh [SPK2]: hair [SPK1]: yes hair [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: and meat. [SPK1]: and meat. Ok. [SPK2]: Oh yeah I'd been thinking hair and then you said hair Ok. [SPK1]: first [SPK2]: so it might make sense to put that number one? [SPK1]: alright [SPK2]: But [SPK1]: yep [SPK2]: again I wouldn't really know where to place meat in that cause I I'd say second [SPK1]: I don't meat is pretty popular [SPK2]: I've heard [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I guess would you say hair pa ah hair meat paper [SPK1]: I don't know maybe we could go with cut paper first. [SPK1]: I don't know. [SPK2]: I can't think of the last time [SPK1]: I haven't dealt with paper. [SPK2]: I cut pa [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: per yeah [SPK1]: neither can I [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: definitely got my hair cut more recently like [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Pe ople who eat meat regularly have probably cut meat more rec ently [SPK1]: pro bably [SPK2]: It's a classic dinner [SPK1]: hmm very Iri [SPK2]: ok so [SPK1]: sh [SPK2]: hair meat paper [SPK1]: ok go [SPK2]: or would [SPK1]: with that [SPK2]: meat be more popular than hair [SPK2]: do you think? [SPK1]: nah ah sure I don't know I I thought of hair first too [SPK2]: ok I think people go to hair first [SPK1]: yeah like [SPK2]: is all haircut is a word meat cut isn't [SPK1]: well in the butchers [SPK2]: [SPK1]: probably alright should we [SPK2]: It's a noun phra [SPK1]: stick with that then [SPK2]: se at best but yeah [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: I think hair meat paper [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: Ok [SPK1]: oh no [SPK2]: [MOD]: now you ha you got the first one and it's hair. obv [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: viously and then it's the paper [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: and the thirdy [SPK1]: just missed it [MOD]: one [SPK2]: [MOD]: is the meat t [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: but well done you did great [SPK2]: cool [MOD]: excellent. [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: And I think that is the end of the quiz. well thank [SPK2]: woo! [MOD]: you for your [SPK1]: great [MOD]: particip [SPK2]: great [MOD]: ation and [SPK1]: That was fast [MOD]: I hope you enjoyed that. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Do you like more questions? [SPK2]: oh it's done? [MOD]: I'm so sorry I don't have any [SPK1]: That would be great [MOD]: [SPK1]: We'll have a chat [SPK2]: no that was fine [MOD]: so yeah thanks very much again.",P006,P007
S03,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,3.4," [MOD] Ok hello we are going to play a quiz. [SPK1] hi [SPK2] hello [SPK2] ok [MOD] I would like to ask you three questions [SPK1] sure [MOD] which were posed to a group of one hundred people [MOD] and I would like you to guess the three most popular anwers to these questions [SPK2] umhm [MOD] and then I will ask you to really have a quick chat about their ranking in terms of popularity. [SPK1] ok [MOD] So for example if I ask you what is normally used to carry patients in a hospital [MOD] you would say thin things like ahm [MOD] wheelchair, a patient's bed for instance ok? [MOD] Is that clear? [SPK1] yeah [SPK2] umhm [MOD] ok. [MOD] So the first question is eh name a public place where you would be more likely to catch ehm a cold or a flu bug. [SPK1] do we take it in turns or [MOD] You can engage in discussion and when you're ready report back to me and I will give you my hee feedback. [SPK2] ok only one or top three you said [SPK1] ok [SPK1] ehm [MOD] three [SPK1] top three yeah [SPK2] three yeah [SPK1] ehm probably hospital is [SPK2] yeah I would I would say number one I suppose [SPK1] yeah [SPK1] ehm [SPK1] maybe somewhere like in old folks home? [SPK1] might be like [SPK1] there's a lot of old people there their immune system they're [SPK1] maybe not so as good as it was so might be passing around a little bit [SPK2] hmm ok and [SPK1] or [SPK1] maybe [SPK2] and the third [SPK1] ehm [SPK2] would be an airport [SPK1] I guess [SPK1] yeah actually that would be definitely yeah [SPK2] yeah [SPK2] ok [SPK1] ah maybe don't know maybe school as well? [SPK2] yeah school would be yeah it's I I would skip the old people house and put school in [SPK1] yeah [SPK1] yeah yeah [SPK2] so yeah [SPK1] yeah probably so hospital then airport then [SPK2] school yeah [SPK1] school yeah [SPK2] cool [SPK1] ok [MOD] Now you have the two ok? You have the school and the hospital, well done [SPK2] umhm [MOD] and you're very close to the third one [MOD] which is not the actual airport but it's the means of transport related. [SPK2] ok cool [SPK1] the airplane [MOD] exactly well done [SPK1] ok [MOD] so would you like to talk about their ranking now? [SPK1] ehm [SPK2] I would say that the no top would be I'd I would say it's hospital and school would be top [SPK1] yeah I I would probably say hospitan then airplane [SPK1] then school [SPK2] yeah [SPK1] cause I think airplanes are very small little com compactable [SPK2] umhm [SPK2] I think airplane would be on top because there's like atmo you know it's closed atmosphere an you're still ??? in theair so I would say yeah probably airplane would be top [SPK1] yeah [SPK1] number one or number two [SPK2] I would make it number one in my opinion [SPK1] hm [SPK1] I'd say number two but [SPK2] ??? [SPK2] ok let's try with that yeah [SPK1] ok [SPK1] so nu [MOD] so what would be the final [SPK1] number one is hospital [MOD] decision? [SPK2] yeah [MOD] hospital [SPK1] and then number two airplane and three school [SPK2] and number two would [SPK2] yeah [MOD] yeah ok [MOD] I'm afraid you got the wrong order. [SPK2] oh [SPK1] oh [SPK2] now what [MOD] so school is the first one the most popular answer, and then it's hospital and the aiplane comes lest last. [SPK2] ah really [SPK1] oh really? [SPK1] ok [SPK2] ok [SPK1] ok [SPK2] ah ok [MOD] yes but good job [MOD] are you ready for the second question now? [SPK1] yeah [SPK2] yeah [MOD] ok [SPK2] sure [MOD] name an istrument in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1] ok eh [SPK1] violin [SPK2] sh eh shello [SPK2] cello or what is [SPK1] cello [SPK2] cello yeah [SPK1] ehm it's three yeah? Three is all. [SPK2] three ah ok the other right [MOD] umhm [SPK1] yeah [MOD] you have the two well done [SPK1] ehm [SPK1] ehm [SPK1] third one [SPK1] might be a double bass? Or [SPK2] what's that right on [SPK1] it's like a bigger cello [SPK2] ah probably yeah [SPK1] ehm [SPK2] it m depend on which o are you talking about a european orchestra or [SPK1] [SPK2] [MOD] [SPK1] ehm [SPK2] or maybe one of the ??? instruments [SPK1] yeah could be I'm not just sym symphony is [SPK2] s s with the sax y n ah [SPK1] is is very particularly means particular kind of orchestra but I'm not sure I think wind instruments are included so maybe flute [SPK2] flute or that saxophone or what do you call that [SPK1] saxophone yeah ehm that would be that would be a brass instrument I think so [SPK2] umhm [SPK1] ehm I think probably violin cello and maybe flute [SPK2] yeah ok yeah [SPK2] that's good that yeah [MOD] you still have two [SPK1] ok [MOD] only two [MOD] so it's the violin and the cello but you're missing one [SPK1] so not not the flute [SPK1] ok [SPK2] eh ah you mean considering that [MOD] you're issing one more eh it's [SPK1] so not flute flute is incorrect [SPK2] ah ok [MOD] yeah [SPK2] eh saxophone is not [SPK1] s [MOD] not really no [SPK1] no ehm [SPK2] what else [SPK1] so might the other can be [SPK1] maybe another string instrument so [SPK2] probably [SPK2] ah piano? [SPK1] could be a vi [MOD] not really [SPK1] maybe a viola? [SPK2] ah [MOD] no these are good ideas but they're not in the list I'm afraid. [SPK1] no or double bass [SPK2] what else is in the usually ok this [SPK1] alright [SPK2] hm what else is in there? is usually [SPK1] ahm well if if there's if there's only strings then the other one is the double bass [SPK1] which I think is probably not [MOD] not really [SPK1] no [MOD] think ab about something that is basic in other types of music as well [SPK1] ahm [SPK2] what else is in [SPK1] ahm or maybe [MOD] in a concert [SPK1] maybe a drum of some sort? [SPK2] I don't think symphony have drums or do they ok [MOD] hmm [SPK1] yeah [SPK2] yes [SPK1] that would be a drum ok [MOD] excellent yeah, it's the drum very good, so what would be the ranking? [SPK2] oh wow [SPK2] ah ok [SPK1] I'd say violin is definitely number one [SPK2] the definitely yeah [MOD] hmm [SPK1] ahm [SPK1] probably then [SPK1] eh cello and then drum [SPK2] probably yeah I would agree yeah [SPK1] waht do you think? [MOD] excellent great [SPK1] yeah [SPK1] ok [SPK2] [SPK1] [MOD] you have the right ranking, very good [MOD] Now the third and final question I would like you to name things that people cut. [SPK2] umhm [SPK1] cut [MOD] yeah [SPK1] ahm [SPK1] fruit, vegetables, meat, skin [SPK1] ehm [SPK2] yeah [SPK1] [SPK2] that's would I think the common would be these anyway [SPK1] yeah that's four of those so [SPK2] what else ve [MOD] you have meat [SPK1] meat ok [MOD] yeap [SPK2] vegetables [MOD] that's the one [SPK2] vegetables? [MOD] nope [SPK1] no [SPK1] ehm themselves? [MOD] nope [SPK2] [SPK1] [SPK1] ehm+ [SPK2] ah wood? [MOD] nope [SPK1] cloth? [MOD] not really [SPK1] or paper? [MOD] excellent [SPK1] paper [MOD] very good [SPK2] paper ok so [MOD] paper is another one [SPK1] ok [SPK2] what else do we cut [SPK1] [MOD] so you're missing one [SPK1] ok so we got meat we got paper [SPK1] ahm it's not fruit not vegetables [SPK1] ahm hair? [MOD] excellent very good [SPK2] yeah [SPK1] oh yeah [SPK1] [MOD] so what would you think about the popularity then of each answer? [SPK1] that's a little more difficult [SPK2] hmmm [SPK1] ahm [SPK2] hair would be top [SPK1] ah+ yeah could be I think maybe hair then paper [SPK1] then meat or would you think meat's above paper [SPK2] I would go with meat above then [SPK2] paper because you know wire lessen all that ah sorry paper lessen all [SPK1] sure yeah [SPK1] yeah [SPK1] ok so [SPK1] hair then meat then paper [SPK2] and then p [SPK2] no? [SPK1] no [MOD] ok so you've change it because the right order was the your original decision so it was [SPK2] [MOD] eh it's hair number one paper number two and meat comes at the end yeah. [SPK1] ok [SPK2] ah ok well [MOD] but very good well done [MOD] ehm and that's the end of the quiz [SPK1] ok [MOD] I hope you enjoyed it thanks thank you for your participation thanks [SPK2] ok [SPK1] yeah [SPK2] ok thank you [SPK1] [SPK1] yeah ",P008,P009

[SPK1]: ok [MOD]: I'd like to ask you three questions which were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. And then I would like you to talk to each other about the ranking of these answers in terms of populartiy. Ok? So for example if I ask you what is typically used to carry patients in a hospital you would say things like you know an ambulance, a wheelchair, a patient's bed or whatever ok? [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: And then you will have to say which one is the most popular answer to th that question Is it clear what you have to do? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: So are you ready for the first question? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: I'm ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: I would lite like you to m name a public place where people m typically get, are likely to get cold or a flu bug. [SPK1]: Sorry there [MOD]: I would like you to [SPK1]: likely to catch [MOD]: think about p public places where you would be mnore likely to get a cold [SPK1]: oh ok [MOD]: or a f lu bug [SPK2]: ok [SPK2]: ah [MOD]: Where would you catch a cold in what public place? [MOD]: Or a bug? [SPK1]: I've heard that airports and airplanes are quite but for this sort of thing. [MOD]: mhmm [MOD]: You got the first one, well done. It's actually the airplane one of the answe [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: rs so you have two more. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Like where you can find cold is it? [MOD]: I mean if you think about different public places [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: where would you be more likely to catch the flu or the cold. [MOD]: The airplane is one [MOD]: then you'll have to find two more answers. [SPK1]: Do we get hints? Is it always from other people that you get [MOD]: Well [SPK1]: cold [MOD]: you could think about places that are crowded, you know if you think about places where you would find more people concentrated in the space [MOD]: and then [MOD]: is easy that it can be contagious within that space. [MOD]: So what kind of think about the different age groups for instance. [MOD]: Where do different people get sick. [MOD]: Ah think about children for instance. [SPK1]: Yeah I guess [SPK1]: school or [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: Yeah that's the other place. Especially like [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: pre-school [MOD]: mhmm mhmm [SPK1]: [MOD]: So the school is another answer. yeah [SPK2]: [SPK2]: May be the ah the hospital? yeah [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK2]: [MOD]: You're you got the third one yeah, very good. So you have the three. Would you like then to have a quick chat about the ranking of these items. [SPK2]: Eh probably is the first the hospital [SPK2]: because it's where [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: ah patients are ah certain times [SPK2]: but [SPK2]: it ah I don't know how to explain like it's eh [SPK2]: it's supposed to be ah [SPK2]: not contami not contaminated but in fact it is, because when patients are waiting for doctors they all ah transmitting their sickness to each other I think [SPK2]: so [SPK1]: ok [SPK1]: So, yes I think in the hospital you would have the [SPK1]: strongest disease that you could get because I think that from all the drugs they have in there [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: only the very strong diseases get [SPK1]: but I think that [SPK1]: the question was what [SPK1]: was it what people would say. [SPK2]: oh [SPK1]: So I think maybe pe people would think of the school more than the hospital because it's not the question where you actually get [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: sick. [SPK2]: but like if I had the three answers [SPK2]: ah [SPK2]: in face of me and the question [SPK2]: I would probably choose the hospital like this is where like I would say in order hospital, then school and then airport [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: airplane [SPK1]: yeah I I [SPK2]: but your your idea is great because [SPK2]: you you're trying to say that this is not where you have sickness, that you can have sickness like pre-school is yeah definitely where you get sick easily. [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I I I agree that most people would have the airplane last [SPK2]: yeah so there you go [SPK1]: And then for the [SPK1]: top two I don't know. [SPK2]: yeah me neither [SPK1]: we can toss a coin [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: [MOD]: Well you would have to make a final decision now. [SPK1]: Ok, so how do we make a final decision? [SPK2]: don't know. [SPK1]: We can talk about it or we can [SPK2]: [SPK1]: do rock, paper, scissors [SPK2]: ok on one time [SPK1]: So, I [SPK1]: So I will say school and you get hospital and we do [SPK2]: If I if I win [SPK1]: rock, paper, scissors or? [SPK2]: this it's hospital in first and if you win [SPK1]: it's school first [SPK2]: school first one time [MOD]: I like your conver sation skills, I like the way you're trying to reach an agreement [SPK1]: [MOD]: right [SPK2]: but because it's all [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: it's also suits me so yeah it's just a good game [SPK1]: yeah because both make sense [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: so let's [MOD]: hmm hmm [SPK1]: chance [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: decide [SPK2]: definitely [SPK1]: it's not [MOD]: yeah yeah [SPK1]: ok, so do we go one, two, three and go? [SPK2]: yeah [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: ok one two, three [SPK2]: two, three [SPK1]: go oh [SPK2]: [SPK1]: ok anyway you still win [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: ok so it's ah hospital first and [SPK2]: hospital first [SPK1]: school second. [MOD]: I'm sorry to report that you didn't get it right so it's [SPK1]: [MOD]: school is number one [SPK2]: that's alright [MOD]: hospital is number two [SPK2]: [MOD]: the airplane comes at [SPK1]: ah ok [MOD]: the end Alright? [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: But good job, very good. [SPK1]: It was fun nevertheless. [MOD]: [SPK1]: yes [MOD]: Now [SPK1]: [MOD]: are you ready for the second question? ok [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: So [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: I would like you to name an instrument in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Eh I'll say the violin [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: very good yep [SPK2]: and piano [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: oh [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: no there no piano ah [SPK2]: trum no [SPK2]: yes or [SPK2]: I don't have the english word for [SPK2]: [SPK1]: But which one is it, in what langua [SPK2]: ah [SPK1]: ge do you have it maybe [SPK2]: ah I'm French so ah [SPK1]: but maybe I will [SPK2]: [SPK1]: underst and so you can try [SPK2]: [SPK1]: that [SPK2]: la harpe like when [SPK1]: ah the harp [SPK2]: the harp yeah [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: ok they have the same meaning makes sense [MOD]: I'm sorry. [SPK2]: no [MOD]: no [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: Ah the cello? [MOD]: Very good yeah you have the two now. [SPK2]: ah [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: Think about the instruments that are commonly used even even in live constre concerts or in different kinds of music really not only in a symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: Guitar? [MOD]: hmm nope [SPK2]: oh [SPK1]: well it's not [MOD]: try again [SPK1]: that much in orchestras [MOD]: keep guessing [SPK1]: though [SPK1]: Trumpet? [MOD]: Good idea but it wasn't one of the popu lar answers [SPK2]: ah [MOD]: I'm afr [SPK1]: No? [MOD]: aid [SPK2]: now you said violin you said [SPK2]: What's the third one? [MOD]: Something that really allows you to give the rhythm as well. [SPK2]: triangle [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Oh that's amazing. That's an amazing answer. [MOD]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: In Christmas carols yes. [SPK1]: yes yeah [MOD]: Definitely. [SPK1]: yeah Well yeah I guess that people said drums [MOD]: Exactly. [SPK1]: yes? but now I'm starting to get nervous, because like in [SPK1]: in gigs like in concerts and in orchestras they don't have the same [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: drums [MOD]: hm the drum [SPK1]: so it's kind of [MOD]: it's the drum [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: but it's very generic it's [MOD]: hm hm [SPK1]: saying oh yeah it's a string instrument [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: and [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: wind instrument and a drum [MOD]: hm hm hm [SPK1]: so [MOD]: But that was in fact the thir d [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: answer [SPK1]: [MOD]: so which of the answers would be the most popular, what would you think? [SPK2]: Violin might be the first. [SPK1]: I agree. No need to [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: [MOD]: And then [SPK2]: and then I don't know [SPK1]: Maybe we need to [MOD]: [SPK2]: no no no say say what you think like [SPK1]: Well to to me they came in the order that I said that so [MOD]: hmm hmm [SPK2]: I think you you're right yeah. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK2]: I agree. I won't say any [SPK1]: [SPK2]: thing more . [MOD]: So is that the final decision, violin, cello and then the drum? Yeah? Well congratulations very good [SPK1]: Oh! [MOD]: you got it right. [SPK1]: Yay! [MOD]: Ok so you have one more that ll third an final question, I would like you to name something that people cut. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Don't really [MOD]: What do [SPK2]: understand. [MOD]: people cut. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: Oh there are so many ways to interpret this [MOD]: Let's take it literally. [MOD]: What do you normally cut? [MOD]: In your everyday life? [SPK1]: Paper? You had [MOD]: very good [SPK1]: before [MOD]: yes [SPK1]: the scissors and I had the paper [MOD]: exactly [SPK1]: [MOD]: paper is one thing. [MOD]: [SPK2]: This is so weird have to think about what you're doing every day. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: ah wood? [MOD]: eh you look like you don't you don't do a lot of cutting [SPK2]: ah [MOD]: [SPK1]: Yeah like it depends also on a person's [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: diet [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: maybe they cut food but [MOD]: Yes, very good thinks about think about different categories of food. [SPK2]: of [SPK2]: cause I I would say wood [MOD]: Hm? [SPK2]: wood [SPK2]: like when you cut a tree or [MOD]: d sorry did you say wood? [SPK2]: Wood yeah. [MOD]: hmm no But if you're talking about food you're very close. [MOD]: You don't do a lot of cooking, do you? [SPK2]: No [MOD]: [SPK1]: We do but that's the thing I think that many people like the vegetables you chop them kind of [MOD]: So what else come to [SPK1]: so [MOD]: what else comes to your mind? [SPK1]: Personally I would say that you would cut bread, because I like to get [MOD]: don't you normally say we slice [SPK1]: like loaf [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: but most people anyway get it already sliced so I don't [MOD]: ok [SPK1]: think that [MOD]: hm [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: people would [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: do that so that's why that's why I mean [SPK1]: the things that I have in my diet [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: and what most people would [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: say [SPK1]: that's what I find [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: difficult to to match. [MOD]: yeah [MOD]: Well, keep guessing. [MOD]: What else in terms of food? [SPK1]: Oh meat. [MOD]: Excellent. That's it yes. [SPK1]: Yeah, I don't eat a lot of that that's why it took me a while . [MOD]: ah ok ok [MOD]: And you're missing one more. [SPK2]: In food also or? [MOD]: No [SPK2]: no? [MOD]: let's just think about different things now [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: Move away from food. [MOD]: I mean this is something you don't cut very frequently very regularly [MOD]: I ma I would think that men usually do that more often than women but it depends again [MOD]: on the individual. [SPK1]: I know that she [SPK2]: Hair? [SPK1]: just said that [SPK2]: is it no [SPK1]: but we have to think about something because [SPK2]: ah no no [SPK1]: I'm out of ideas. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Hair maybe? [MOD]: Excellent well done. [SPK2]: Hair. [MOD]: Hair. [SPK1]: Oh ni [MOD]: yes [SPK1]: ce! [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: So what would be the ranking in terms of popularity? What would you think? [SPK2]: Paper first. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: Hair second and then meat. I would say this. [SPK1]: Very good very good yes yes, I like that. [MOD]: Do you agree, is that your final decision? [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: Do you agree? [MOD]: Yes? [SPK2]: [MOD]: Yes? [SPK1]: Yes. [MOD]: Well I'm sorry to report that paper is the most popular answer, ok? [SPK1]: ok, we got [MOD]: Eh so paper number one, eh sorry hair number one [SPK1]: ! [MOD]: paper number two [SPK2]: oh! [MOD]: meat number three. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: ! [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: Almost. [MOD]: But well done [SPK2]: [MOD]: good job [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: thank you [MOD]: and [MOD]: and that is the end of the quiz, I hope [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: you enjoyed it. [SPK1]: Yeah it was [MOD]: Thank you very much. [SPK1]: interesting. [SPK2]: very interesting. [MOD]: thank you Thank",P010,P011
S05,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.8,2.0,"[MOD]: Ok hi welcome, thank you for coming today. We're going to play a quiz. I would like to ask you three questions which were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: Ok? [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: And then I will ask you to talk to each other and guess the ranking of the answers in terms of popularity. So for example if I say what are some ways in which you can pe carry patients to the hospital you would say things like an ambulance, wheelchair, patient's bed ok? And then you would [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: try to see to find which one of these were you know was the most popular answer and so on [SPK2]: Is it [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: are they gonna be general questions or it's something where it depends on the audience what would be the [MOD]: uhuh [SPK2]: most likely [MOD]: hm [SPK2]: answer [MOD]: hm It was just a group of one hundred participants and they [SPK2]: mixed [MOD]: yes [SPK1]: yeah su [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: So [SPK1]: pposed to be a random sample. [MOD]: Exactly so we don't ha [SPK2]: [MOD]: ve a specific profile of these participants [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: is that ok? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Do you have any other [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: questions? [SPK1]: hmm I mean they there won't be any I mean [MOD]: no [SPK1]: we won't have the question written or a [MOD]: No I will just give [SPK1]: nything ah [MOD]: them to you orally and then you will have the opportunity to discuss I would really like you to work together. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: And have a discussion before you're able to give y me your final decisions. Is that ok? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Right. [MOD]: So, the first think I would like you to name is a public place where you would be more likely to catch f the flu or a cold. [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: [SPK1]: The the bus? [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: s some [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: thing like yeah? [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: I mean it's eh that was not one of the ah that's a good idea [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: it's it wasn't one of the most popular answers but think about other means of transport. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: hm [SPK2]: Airplane I think [MOD]: Excellent [SPK2]: airplane. [MOD]: very good [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: yeah. [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: So you have one, you need two more now. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: hmm The t there is a train as well but [MOD]: Well the other two answers are not really means of transport. [SPK1]: oh ok [SPK2]: [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: So think about other public places. [SPK2]: Well like schools and [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: You know like daycare kind of sort of [MOD]: Excellent, very good. So school is an the other one, yeah? [SPK1]: Well eh [SPK1]: I don't know you you can get it also like in a hospital but I'm not sure [MOD]: Excellent [SPK1]: yeah well [MOD]: yes indeed yeah. [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: So that was the other answer. So you have the three, would you like us to would you like to have a quick chat about the popularity of these answers so what's [SPK2]: the [MOD]: what's the most popular answer? [SPK1]: So it's eh So it's hospital, school and airplane. [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: So [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Maybe school? [SPK2]: Yeah be [SPK1]: but [SPK2]: cause y y young [SPK1]: because [SPK2]: like a [SPK1]: it's yeah young child [SPK2]: children yeah [SPK1]: dren but but hospital you have more mixed but I don't know [SPK2]: [SPK1]: hm [SPK2]: Yeah but you can I d I don't know I'm not sure whether you you you know you catch more sickness when you're already sick you know sort of eh [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: Cause it feels li I don't know for me it feels like that you know in schools because especially parents they tend to send their children to school when they're sick [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: and then it's just kind of [SPK2]: you know y you know it was sort of kind of and stuff [SPK1]: yeah when one is sick yeah [SPK2]: I don't know like I don't I don't have the impression I mean cause I know a few people working hospitals and that they got sick that often so you you I mean you have people coming to visit but I mean you have people already sick [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: so you can't [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: count them in and then you know you have people that [SPK1]: yeah I think I would go with [SPK2]: that sort of [SPK1]: with school as well as the the f the most popular [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: god hm [SPK2]: I think well the airplane is also I just heard that you you are I don't know maybe it's because you're kind of in a closed space maybe the sanitary kind of conditions are not great I don't know. [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I just heard that you know so and then I think it's how to say it like I once traveled with a cold and it really aggravates your cold I think, so d you know you tend to feel like I think it tends to be more painful than say train travel I think but I'm not sure whether that actually affects you know be more infectious. [SPK1]: Yeah but because in airplane most likely to be you know adults. [SPK1]: They might not you know try to you know cover the their mouth or having baby that might not [SPK1]: be as [SPK1]: not dangerous but give a risk of infection as children who will just you know touch everything and every [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: one. [SPK2]: But at the same time like I think you you're more likely to travel when you're sick. [SPK2]: I mean by by airplane because you know you already booked a plane and you know unless you've got insurance and you you're gonna cancel the flight [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: I think. [SPK2]: So I I at least I would be more likely to travel by by plane when I'm sick I don't know I don't know by bus or by train or something because it's something you can avoid sort of. [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: I don't know I'm not sure whether it it [MOD]: But are you talking about the [SPK1]: Eh no [MOD]: probability where eh you would have more chances I mean [MOD]: are you trying to think about the ho you know probability of getting sick or are you looking at the popularity of the answers? [SPK2]: [MOD]: So [SPK2]: Well ob viously there's a reasoning about I think it's more likely that [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: you know get sick [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: of then it's maybe some [MOD]: right [SPK2]: ing that'll be you know [MOD]: ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I don't know maybe maybe [SPK1]: I don't know [SPK2]: hospitals yeah maybe that 'll be more int intuitive I don't know eh [SPK1]: Yeah I I honestly [MOD]: [SPK1]: I don't think airplane would pro necessa [SPK2]: rily be a popular answer I think [SPK2]: in that I think it's logic I don't think [SPK1]: yes so [SPK2]: it's necessarily very b gonna be very popular [SPK1]: So [MOD]: So what would be your final ranking then? [SPK2]: I'd say hos pitals befo [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: re airplanes I don't know [MOD]: And would the top [SPK1]: hm I I then I would you know hospital before [SPK2]: top would be [SPK1]: airplane would in first would be schools yeah [SPK2]: bef and school yeah yeah [MOD]: So, is it schools, hospitals and airplanes? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Excellent, you got it. That was the right ranking very good. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: Now let's move on to the second question. I would like you to name an instrument in a symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: oh [SPK2]: Violin. [SPK1]: eh [MOD]: Very good that's one [SPK2]: [MOD]: yeah. [SPK2]: Cello. [MOD]: Excellent, yes. [SPK1]: and eh [MOD]: One more? [SPK1]: eh [SPK1]: Bass? [SPK1]: but [MOD]: hmm no [SPK1]: I've a not a very [SPK1]: yeah here again my English is lacking sligh [SPK2]: [SPK1]: tly [MOD]: Well this is a [SPK1]: the flute? [MOD]: simple I would like you to think about instruments that are commonly used in even in live concert concerts or you know different types of music [SPK1]: maybe a flu te? [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: hm No? [MOD]: No but try again. [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: [SPK2]: But it wouldn't be kind of extravagant like an ha a harp or [MOD]: No [SPK2]: something [MOD]: I mean it's a common English word cause you v because you mentioned your limited vocabulary about instruments [SPK1]: [MOD]: the I mean this musical instrument is [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: very commonly used in English, it's a common simple word. [SPK1]: ok so [SPK2]: Like a [SPK1]: [SPK2]: trumpet? [MOD]: Nope. [SPK2]: No. [MOD]: It allows you to give the rhythm the melody as well. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: hmm [SPK1]: I guess so eh a drum? [MOD]: Yes that's it [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: very good. So [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: you now have the three ok? Would you like [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: us would you like to talk about their ranking? [SPK1]: Oh ok so you said So [SPK2]: So we [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ah in terms popularity then [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: Maybe violin would be [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: the first ye [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: ah [SPK2]: yeah I think so [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: I think that's very [SPK1]: Yeah violin [SPK1]: and then cello and then drum? Because it's it's I thought of violin, just couldn't catch the word in English so [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK1]: and yeah [SPK1]: I don't know if you agree. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I I'm not sure the [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: last two but [SPK2]: Yeah I think it's probably what people would think of cause I don't really think of like drums I mean they're kind of they're more on the background I think like [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: I think everything that gives rhythm is not I mean i it's obviously very necessary but at the same time it's it's not very [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: hm [MOD]: prominent [SPK2]: yeah and I think it's better because you know cellos tend to be quite big as well I th and also and [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: usually I think they're placed in front of the you know from the stage you know so [SPK1]: yeah in front yeah yeah [SPK2]: drums they tend to be at the side or at the back I think [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: sort of so it wouldn't be as visible I'd say. [MOD]: So what would be your final decision? [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: yeah vi [SPK1]: like ah violin [SPK2]: violin, cello and then [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [MOD]: You're very good. [SPK1]: and then drum. yeah [MOD]: Well done [SPK1]: [MOD]: you got it [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: very good. [MOD]: So now the third and the final question, I would like you to name something that people cut. [SPK2]: cut [MOD]: Things that people cut. [SPK1]: Cut? [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: That's very broad. [MOD]: [SPK1]: Yes. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Carrots? [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I I I I [MOD]: ok [SPK1]: came with apple but eh ah [MOD]: Well think about food but l think about a different category of food [MOD]: not foo fruit or vegetables. [SPK2]: Eh meat? [MOD]: Very good yeah. That that [SPK1]: So [MOD]: was one. [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: ok so [SPK2]: Bread? [MOD]: I mean ok meat is one answer but the n forget about the food now move to other things [SPK2]: ok ok [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: that was just a food item [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Wood? [MOD]: y [SPK2]: no [MOD]: yeah good idea but it wasn't one of the popu lar answers [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: [SPK1]: a juat [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Hair? [MOD]: Yes [SPK1]: [MOD]: very good. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: Very good. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: And one more? [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Go ahead. I I [SPK2]: no no no I'm [SPK1]: I feel [SPK2]: I don't know [SPK1]: like ah [SPK2]: cut [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ok so we have we have meat we have [SPK1]: hair [SPK2]: hair [SPK1]: meat and hair [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: So we have we have food and we have something on the [SPK1]: nai [SPK2]: person [SPK1]: ls? [SPK2]: so [SPK1]: yeah but that's already yeah [SPK2]: yeah maybe that it has to be something else [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK2]: So maybe that's something that is not animate not food [SPK1]: maybe with like scissors, paper? No? [MOD]: Paper [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: well done [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: that was the other one. [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: So in terms of popularity how would you rank these answers? [SPK2]: I don't think that meat is very popular. [MOD]: hm [SPK1]: nah [SPK2]: I think I think paper would [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: probably be very [SPK2]: that very popoular answer. [SPK1]: Yeah but I think hair as well is I don't know eh i it's both with scissors so I don't know [SPK2]: [SPK1]: yeah many paper [SPK2]: cut hair [SPK1]: ah I don't know eh sorry [SPK2]: paper I think I don't know you made me unsure again yeah I think I think you're right I think meat should probably be very close [SPK1]: hmm hmm [SPK2]: I don't know it's not something that I think you [SPK2]: that I just I just [SPK1]: yeah but [SPK2]: tend to think of food and I think that's why I came you know [SPK1]: yeah we we ask me something of cutting eh instantly for food in first not not meat but food so it's ah [SPK2]: yeah yeah yeah yeah [SPK2]: So I think well I don't think it's a popular answer like [SPK1]: hm [SPK1]: yeah maybe not [MOD]: What would be the first thing that would come to most people's minds? [SPK1]: Maybe I would say hair but I don't know I I didn't follow it now it seems logical now that now that you said it so [SPK2]: Well i don't know I think it's paper actually [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: [SPK1]: ok you so you [SPK2]: [SPK1]: So you would say paper, hair and [SPK2]: meat [SPK1]: meat [MOD]: Is that your final decision?

[SPK1]: No. Not at [SPK2]: Yeah I think it's a place that we're supposed to [MOD]: A place [SPK1]: [MOD]: it could be something more v for example soemthing that people use to commute or a means of transportation [SPK2]: yeah transport yeah [SPK2]: the bus and [SPK1]: oh yeah the bus [SPK1]: Not yet?

[SPK2]: I think I would say school in first. [SPK1]: School first good. [SPK2]: Like everyone's [SPK2]: as yeah as a child [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: mhmm mhmm [SPK2]: yeah I don't know.

[MOD]: Yeah sure sure [SPK2]: yeah bass or battery [MOD]: [SPK1]: I don't know. I used to play bass so I think that that is. [MOD]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: [MOD]: Apart from the bass so [MOD]: Who would be behind [SPK1]: I see [MOD]: you, who would be placed behind you? [SPK1]: The battery [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: no? [MOD]: Battery?

S08,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.4,2.8,"[MOD]: So good evening [SPK2]: Good evening. [MOD]: a nd welcome [SPK1]: Good evening. [MOD]: nice to see you and thank you for coming. [MOD]: so today we're going to play a quiz. [MOD]: I'm going to eh ask you ah questions that have been previously ah posed to one hundred of people and I want you to give me the three most popular answers to each question. So for example if I ask you what do people use to ahm to transfer eh patients your answers would be like ambulance or wheelchair or hospital bed and then I would ask you to rank these three answers in terms of popularity. Is everything clear? [SPK2]: [MOD]: No worries I mean there's no right or wrong you don't have really to know something just guess what would be [SPK2]: eh ok I was thinking about the vocabulary. [MOD]: ah [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: yeah it's [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: Ok yeah maybe the the example I gave you was a bit you know it needed some kind of terminology but I think that the actual questions will be easier. eh no worries you can describe it's it's not [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: We'll find the the solution. [MOD]: eh so especially with regrding the second part where you have to rank the three eh answers that you give, I want you to collaborate with each other, talk with each other reach a final decision and then ah let me know. Ok? [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: I will guide [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: you also through the [MOD]: Ah so the first question, I would like you to give me the three most popular answers to the question name a public place where people are likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: [MOD]: So [SPK1]: So [MOD]: ah public place what would be a public place [SPK2]: each one of us gives different or [MOD]: eh just start [SPK2]: we just [MOD]: talking [SPK2]: eh [MOD]: and [SPK1]: toge eh the people get cold in it? [MOD]: yes [SPK1]: on it yeah ok [MOD]: What would be th a place [SPK1]: the beach [SPK2]: The the beach? [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: maybe The pool [SPK2]: I would say [SPK1]: [SPK2]: eh a pool [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: ok yes A park? [SPK1]: the park [SPK2]: [SPK1]: maybe [SPK2]: A port? [MOD]: All these are yeah these [SPK1]: the port yeah [MOD]: very good ideas but it's just that they are not among the three most popular answers so keep gue [SPK2]: [MOD]: ssing yeah [SPK2]: An airport? [MOD]: you're very close, not exactly the place [SPK1]: The bus? [MOD]: but the but the means of transport? [SPK1]: The bus? [MOD]: In an airport? [SPK2]: Airplane? [MOD]: Airplane [SPK2]: [MOD]: yes air plane is [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: one of the three [SPK1]: Really? [MOD]: Yes. ok [MOD]: [SPK1]: One of the three we want another two [MOD]: Exactly. [SPK2]: We can [SPK2]: look for [SPK1]: the hospital [SPK2]: [MOD]: Very good. [SPK2]: ah [MOD]: Great, yes. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Lot of viruses there. [MOD]: So two out of three. We need one [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: more. Ah think about different age grou [SPK2]: achool. [MOD]: yes I was about to [SPK1]: Sorry? [MOD]: tell [SPK2]: The school. [MOD]: school yeah [SPK1]: The school yeah . [MOD]: Excellent, you're great, good job. So, I'd like you to [MOD]: to rank them in terms of popularity, what people think are most popular. So you have [SPK1]: What people think or the the [MOD]: no not the actual, what people think so [SPK1]: actual ok what people think [MOD]: yeah there's no ground truth so we have hospital, school and airplane ah waht would be the [SPK1]: Hospital I think [SPK2]: Hospital the first yes [SPK1]: it's scary [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Then maybe school? [SPK1]: Maybe sco school yeah. Then the airport. [SPK2]: Then the airplane. [MOD]: Is this your final decision? [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: yes [MOD]: ok [SPK1]: [MOD]: ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: Very good, I'm afraid you just had to swap the two first, so first it's ah it's school, then hospital and the third one [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: is aiplane, but very good job, yeah thank you. [MOD]: Are you ready for the the second one? [SPK1]: Yeah fine. [MOD]: ok [SPK2]: umhm [MOD]: So [MOD]: Name an instrument that one can find in a symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: Name [SPK1]: Symphony? [MOD]: An [SPK2]: and? [MOD]: instrument.

[SPK1]: Violin? [MOD]: Great! Excellent. [SPK2]: [MOD]: unani [SPK2]: [MOD]: mous decision yeah. [SPK1]: makes sense this popu lar [MOD]: [SPK2]: Violoncello? [MOD]: Great, the yeah the the the second part cello, yeah [SPK2]: ah we are loo weare looking for the [MOD]: eh but it [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: 's the same I mean yeah I'm just quoting the exact word yeah you're very good. very good so you [SPK2]: eh [MOD]: have two violin and cello [SPK2]: of the three most [MOD]: and you need [SPK2]: [MOD]: one more [MOD]: eh [SPK1]: eh [SPK2]: We are looking for the three most popular? [MOD]: exactly [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: What peo [SPK1]: The what [MOD]: ple think. [SPK2]: What [MOD]: I mean [SPK2]: people think [MOD]: what people have answered as popular. Yeah [SPK1]: it's ca lled ah [SPK1]: I'm not clever in this [SPK1]: the one with the big [MOD]: [SPK2]: ah the saxophone no [SPK1]: no [SPK2]: no [MOD]: Trumpet? [SPK1]: I think yes, this one. [MOD]: But no [SPK1]: no [MOD]: eh [SPK1]: it is not [MOD]: I mean great idea [SPK2]: Piano? [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: No. [SPK2]: No. [MOD]: It's yeah [SPK1]: orchestra [MOD]: is I mean sh piano should be in the list but it's not. [SPK2]: not [MOD]: Different [SPK2]: Lyra? [SPK2]: I don't know how it's called in English. [MOD]: [SPK2]: it is [SPK1]: Which one? [SPK2]: It is a big havi ng like [MOD]: like harp [SPK2]: fifty y [SPK1]: like the [SPK2]: chords [SPK1]: harp [SPK2]: yes [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: like the harp [MOD]: more or less but no [SPK2]: no [MOD]: Ah something not with strings, something else something that keeps the rhythm [SPK2]: something else [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ah [SPK1]: like the drums? [SPK2]: eh [MOD]: [MOD]: Great. Excellent. [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: drum the symphony drum yeah [SPK1]: I don't know its name but [MOD]: It's not the normal drum set you can find [SPK1]: yeas yeah [MOD]: in a symphony orchestra but the rather the big one [SPK1]: to keep the rhythm [MOD]: eh yeah ok great. Ah so what do you think would be the correct order in terms of popularity? [MOD]: So you have I will remind you violin, you have [SPK2]: [MOD]: cello and you have drum. [SPK1]: Violin? [SPK2]: Violin? [SPK2]: you think [SPK1]: the first [MOD]: [SPK1]: eh and then the drums maybe? [SPK2]: May be yes. [SPK1]: to give the rhythm? and then the [SPK2]: and then [SPK1]: cello [SPK2]: cello. [SPK2]: umhm [MOD]: Are you sure? [SPK2]: [MOD]: no [SPK1]: we think we think [MOD]: [SPK1]: we're not sure [SPK2]: cello drums [SPK1]: we think [MOD]: exactly exactly so [SPK1]: [MOD]: actua [SPK2]: [MOD]: lly the order that you guessed eh was [SPK2]: umhm [MOD]: the actual order that people [SPK1]: the right one yeah [MOD]: answered, but nevermind I mean you were very quick in identifying the three eh answers [SPK2]: [MOD]: so [MOD]: let's move on to the third and final question. And this is name something that people cut. [SPK2]: cut [SPK1]: cut? [SPK2]: knife or something that [MOD]: not the instrument [SPK2]: an object that eh [MOD]: the the object that is being [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: cut [SPK1]: vegetables [SPK2]: eh yes [MOD]: something [SPK2]: you want the vegetable? [MOD]: no no no [SPK2]: [SPK1]: something so specific [MOD]: no no I'm not [SPK2]: [MOD]: that demanding ah [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: somehting very close it's also food [SPK1]: meat? [MOD]: yes excellent [SPK1]: meat [MOD]: great [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: Thank you. [SPK1]: Makes sense. [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: and [SPK1]: paper [MOD]: Paper! You have the [SPK2]: paper? [MOD]: second one. [SPK1]: papercut? [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: Yeah, now it's a very generic question people can cut like lots of things but [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: The answers also may be may vary [SPK1]: rece ntly the jeans recently [MOD]: [SPK1]: they know this [MOD]: that's true very it'a a very clever [SPK2]: so we have one other [MOD]: oh yeah yeah you still ah missing one. [SPK2]: Trees? [SPK2]: to make the paper [SPK1]: Right. Perfect. [MOD]: but [SPK1]: Nice idea. [SPK2]: But not [MOD]: [SPK1]: nice idea. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: ah paper people cut [SPK2]: [SPK1]: people cut [MOD]: Something that has to do with ah the way we look? [MOD]: and both [SPK1]: clothes? [MOD]: No ahm [MOD]: Something that e everybody, both men and women eh do ah often [SPK1]: Hair? [SPK2]: Sorry? [SPK1]: Hair. [MOD]: Hair. [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: Exactly I was about to [SPK2]: Nice. [MOD]: to tell you whether men or women do cut their hair more often but then it it that depends. on the style, I guess yeah. [SPK1]: That depends yeah [MOD]: [MOD]: ok great, so we have [SPK1]: to rank them? [MOD]: meat we have paper, we have hair. What do you think is the right order. [SPK2]: Meat. [SPK1]: Meat, not hair? [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Hair. [MOD]: [SPK1]: Meat makes sense. Makes sense. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: No? [SPK2]: [SPK1]: No? [SPK2]: [MOD]: Ah you you have to tell me the the whole [SPK1]: oh the whole the whole order [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: Then meat ah [SPK2]: hair [SPK1]: hair, then [SPK2]: paper [SPK1]: paper [SPK1]: no [MOD]: I'm so sorry [SPK1]: [MOD]: first is hair [SPK2]: first is [MOD]: and [SPK2]: hair? [MOD]: second is paper [SPK1]: pa [MOD]: and third is [SPK1]: really? [MOD]: meat. [SPK2]: third? [MOD]: I un derstand that you said meat because it's it was the first answer and usually what first comes to mind you judge it as [SPK1]: no because it's like you said that [SPK2]: no yes [SPK1]: the you may not cut your hair but you have to cut your meat all the time [MOD]: yes yeah I [SPK2]: [MOD]: I guess it's what comes to the mind of the people that are being [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: asked it's [SPK1]: yeah right [MOD]: it's but thank you you are great thank you good job. [SPK1]: thank you [MOD]: Ah thank you very much, I hope [SPK2]: [MOD]: That's it I hope you had fun. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Thank you. that's it [MOD]: That's it yeah no more questions [SPK1]: thank you [MOD]: but it seems you want more [SPK2]: [MOD]: Ok now thank you very much [SPK2]: It was funny. [MOD]: That's it. Thank you. [SPK1]: Thank you. [SPK2]: ok thank",P018,P019
S09,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.6,3.6,"[MOD]: Ok [SPK2]: Yeah so [MOD]: So I would like us to pay play a quiz. Right? [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: So I would like to ask you three questions that were posed to a group of one hundred people. [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: And I would like you to guess, talk to each other and guess the three most popular answers to these questions. And then I will ask you to decide on the ranking. Ok do you in terms of popularity. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So for example like if I ask you name what are the main ways in which you can transfer patients [MOD]: in hospital. You would say something like you know a wheelchair, an ambulance, a patient's bed and then I will ask you to talk to each other and decide upon a ranking. O [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: k? [MOD]: Is that clear? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: [Do you have any ques] tions? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [MOD]: Nope? [SPK2]: N [MOD]: ok? [SPK2]: o. I suppose no it's [MOD]: Alright? [SPK2]: ok yeah thanks. [MOD]: So if you're ready for the first question I would like you to name public places where you would be more likely to get the cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Right [SPK1]: So I imagine [SPK2]: I was just thinking where we're sitting like in a university or something like The univ [SPK1]: that. ersity somewhere where it's always like in colder places as well. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: But high concentration of pe ople. [SPK2]: Exactly. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Schools. [SPK2]: Schools. Yeah. [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK2]: Airports. [MOD]: You got the one. [SPK2]: Airplanes. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: hmm I don't know if you get these much in the west. [SPK1]: But indoor sort of ski things. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Or like indoor sort of [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK1]: kind of like sports venues. [SPK2]: I know what you mean we don't have a lot of indoor ski [SPK1]: Because they have it like in [SPK2]: in Ireland but [SPK1]: America and in sort of the Middle East [SPK2]: Yeah yeah. [SPK1]: but I don't know if [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: that wouldn't be an answer. [SPK2]: I can imagine. [SPK1]: Just because a lot of things could get caught in the snow. Anyway [SPK2]: Ye ah . [SPK1]: I just thought about the concentration of people so. [MOD]: Keep guess ing. [SPK2]: Well at school well like maybe doctor's surgeries and hospitals [SPK1]: Must [SPK2]: probably. [SPK1]: be hospitals. [MOD]: hmm that's the second one. [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: Yes very good hospit [SPK2]: And [MOD]: als. [SPK1]: So where is [SPK2]: Airports and airplanes really no I always thought air [MOD]: Ex [SPK2]: ports would [MOD]: cellent. [SPK1]: Ah. [SPK2]: o [MOD]: Air [SPK2]: k. [MOD]: planes [MOD]: So you've got the three. [SPK1]: Great. [MOD]: So I would like you now to decide about you know about the ranking what were [SPK1]: What would the hundred people say first? [MOD]: Yeah. Yeah. [SPK2]: It's like a game of family fortunes. ok. [SPK1]: Yeah . [MOD]: Which one was [SPK2]: What do you think? [MOD]: the most popular answer? [SPK1]: I might [SPK2]: I'd say Go on . [SPK1]: I was only [SPK2]: [SPK1]: going to say hospital number one purely because it's like highest concentration of [SPK2]: Of really sick people [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: maybe yeah yeah. [SPK1]: But then schools or hospital s? [SPK2]: I'd say schools just because young children just tends to be lots of runny noses and things around and [SPK1]: Less hygie ne. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Teachers are sick a lot. And then maybe airports Airplanes [SPK1]: ports yeah. [SPK2]: after the number three? [SPK1]: I think that would make sense. [SPK2]: I'm happy with it. [SPK1]: Schools first. [SPK2]: Or no didn't you say ehm [SPK1]: say hospitals [SPK2]: hospitals doctors [SPK1]: but what do you think? [SPK2]: Surgeries first schools secon [SPK1]: Would you agree with that? [SPK2]: d. Yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah. Hospitals, schools, airplane [MOD]: So is that the fi [SPK1]: airports. [MOD]: nal ranking? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Hos pitals, schools, airplanes? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: I am sorry but you didn't get the [SPK2]: [MOD]: first two right. [SPK2]: Oh we didn't win the prize. Oh no! [SPK1]: Tell the [MOD]: School is number one [SPK2]: Is it? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: [Hospital's] number two and then airplane you got that [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: right. It's [SPK1]: Fair enough. [MOD]: the third one. [SPK2]: Done well. [MOD]: Alright? Very good. [MOD]: Are you ready for the second question? [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: Sure. [MOD]: I would like you to nu nu now think about musical instruments in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Oh the most popular [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Most popular [MOD]: Answers. [SPK2]: or [MOD]: so [SPK2]: Most pop [MOD]: Yes. [SPK2]: ular okay. I would say probably [SPK1]: Violin. [SPK2]: violin. Yeah. hmm [MOD]: Would [SPK2]: be number one. [MOD]: Very good yes. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Cello? [SPK1]: [MOD]: That's correct. Well done. [SPK1]: Wow! and [SPK2]: A nd [SPK1]: Drums. [SPK2]: Flute? [MOD]: Ah very good. You're [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: very [SPK2]: Very good. [MOD]: good, very fast. [SPK1]: [MOD]: So what would be your ranking then? [SPK1]: Violin first yeah. [SPK2]: I'd say violin number one. [SPK2]: Cello maybe number two? [SPK1]: Yeah I wouldn't know between cello or drums. That was a shot in the dark from me so I think yeah. [SPK2]: Drums. [SPK2]: Three. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Is [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: that your final yeah? [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: Well done. [MOD]: Yes. [SPK1]: Good stuff. [SPK2]: Nice [MOD]: [You're right] violin, [SPK2]: one yeah. [MOD]: cello and the drum. [SPK2]: ok. [SPK1]: Brilliant. [MOD]: Very good. [MOD]: Let's see if you can guess n the third one. I would like you to name [MOD]: things that people cut. [SPK2]: Things that people cut? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK2]: ok. [SPK2]: Like with a scissors or a knife or something? [MOD]: Things that [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: people cut. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Food? Is that an answer that Within [MOD]: would suffice? that category would you be more specific? [SPK1]: oh ok. [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Bread. [SPK2]: Bread [SPK1]: Bread. [SPK2]: exactly yeah that's a good one. [SPK1]: But then I don't know or I was just thinking vegetables [SPK2]: [SPK1]: in my head. [SPK2]: Yeah. Would you say cut or slice I mean [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: is is it specific to the word? Definitely bread or meat would you cut meat? [MOD]: Excell ent that's it. [SPK2]: ok. [MOD]: Meat. Yep. [SPK2]: Cut paper? [MOD]: Very good. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yes that's another one. [SPK1]: That's what I was thinking. [SPK2]: Cut [SPK1]: Hair. [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK2]: Hair. [MOD]: Well done. [SPK2]: [MOD]: You're very fast. [SPK2]: [MOD]: So [SPK2]: [MOD]: what do you think about the most popular [MOD]: answer which was it? [SPK1]: I straight away thought food but [SPK2]: ok. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: that might be because I'm hungry. [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: So I don't know because hair seems like the kind of answer [SPK2]: Go for it then. [SPK1]: that people would give straight away. I don't know. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Or paper is ah [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: [SPK2]: pa I I've I've no idea about the ranking. [SPK1]: If pe [SPK2]: I [SPK1]: ople asked [SPK2]: If people were asked [SPK1]: I think [SPK2]: I'd say maybe paper. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Although [SPK1]: Pape [SPK2]: Yeah I don't know. [SPK1]: ha meat. I think meat would [SPK2]: Meat. [SPK1]: maybe come last because [SPK2]: Do you think? [SPK1]: It's quite specific food [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: so people maybe [SPK2]: I'm surprised [SPK1]: would say food. [SPK2]: bread isn't on it. Ok well then paper, hair, meat? [SPK1]: Yeah. I think that might be it. [MOD]: Yes? [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: [SPK2]: No we're wrong. Meat [MOD]: It's cu ah hair first. [SPK2]: Hair first wow. [SPK1]: Hair okay yeah. [MOD]: Paper number two. and meat [SPK2]: ok. [SPK1]: Awh that's right ok. [MOD]: you're right number three. [MOD]: Yep. [MOD]: So that is the end of the quiz. [SPK2]: Ok! [MOD]: I hope you enjoyed it. Thank you ve [SPK2]: Learnt [MOD]: ry much. [SPK2]: a lot [MOD]: [SPK2]: thank you. [SPK1]: No worries. ",P020,P021
S10,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.8,2.6,"[MOD]: Ok. So I would like us to play a quiz. Ok? I'm going to ask you three questions that were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the most popular answers to these questions. And then I will ask you to talk to each other and decide upon the ranking in terms of popularity. Ok? So I might just ask questions like ah what do you usually use to transfer patients you know in a hospital you wou might say an ambulance, a patient's eh bed or a wheelchair. Alright? And then I will ask you to tell me which one was the most popular answer so [SPK1]: Mhmm. [MOD]: Ah that's all really. Do you have any questions? [SPK2]: No that [SPK1]: No. [SPK2]: seems [MOD]: No? [SPK2]: fi [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: ne. [MOD]: Ok right. [MOD]: So Let's go for the first question now I would like you to name public places where people y wou we you would be more likely to catch the flu or a cold. [MOD]: So public places where you would catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: Ok well ah school [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Very good you got the [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: one yeah . [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Oh like are we supposed to collaborate with this [MOD]: Yep yes. [SPK2]: together? ok [SPK1]: ok yeah school is one [SPK1]: probably like a nursing home or like what'd you think yeah like carehome? [SPK2]: Yeah that's a good one yeah a hospital as well. [SPK1]: Yeah [MOD]: That's the [SPK1]: like a yeah [MOD]: second one [SPK1]: yeah. [MOD]: you found the second one yes. [SPK1]: [MOD]: So you n eed to find one more. [SPK2]: Maybe public transport? [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Can you give [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: a specific examples? [SPK1]: I'd guess a [SPK2]: bus it ten [SPK1]: bus [SPK2]: ds to be pretty confined [MOD]: Sure, but that was not one of the popular most popular [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: answers. Yeah. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Is it not like what I've [MOD]: It is a means of transport [SPK1]: like ot's a public tran [MOD]: ation [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: but it's not the bus. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Guess ah trains [SPK1]: Train yeah [SPK2]: planes [MOD]: That's it planes ok so you got the [SPK2]: oh ok [MOD]: three now so [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: what would you think about their ranking? [MOD]: Which one was the most popular answer? [SPK1]: I'd say hospital or what would [SPK2]: It's that people would associate hospital more with [SPK2]: the flu. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Maybe it's a bias that they would I mean people would be less likely to be in a hospital than to be in school perhaps or to be in [SPK2]: some forms of public transp ort. [SPK1]: Yeah that's true yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: So it's just one two three kind of what we think? [MOD]: Yeah. Yep. I can give you [SPK1]: Oh [MOD]: my feedback at the end. [SPK1]: ok. [SPK1]: So what what do you think like if you were to do one two three. [SPK2]: And we need to think about what one hundred people answered. [MOD]: Yes what came first to their mind, to most people's minds. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK2]: I would guess ho spital [SPK1]: Hospital I would have so hospi [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: tal first yeah. [SPK1]: probably then school cause I wouldn't immediately jump to public transport [SPK2]: Yeah ha. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Ah then [SPK1]: But mine would be that [SPK2]: airplanes [SPK1]: that that's my first that one anyway it would be [SPK1]: the hospital then the school then the plane but what what do you think? [SPK2]: Yeah, I'd put the hospital first [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: and then [SPK2]: yeah it seems like a reasonable order to me. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Is that your final ranking yeah? [MOD]: Ok well I'm afraid you got the first two wrong because [SPK1]: Really? [MOD]: yeah most people went for the school first and then hospital and the airplane came last. Alright? [SPK1]: Ok. Ok. [MOD]: Ok? Good job! [MOD]: We're going [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: Moving on to the second one. [MOD]: I would like you to name a musical instrument in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: V violin was my first [SPK2]: Yeah that was what [MOD]: Yes [SPK2]: first came came [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: my head as well [SPK1]: oh yeah [SPK2]: yeah. [MOD]: Great very good yeah, that's it. [SPK1]: Cello ? [SPK2]: Yeah [MOD]: Very good [SPK2]: that's a [MOD]: yes [SPK2]: cello [MOD]: yes, that was another one. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Double bass. [MOD]: Nope. [SPK2]: A bit more [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: [SPK1]: s I'd say w would be like some sort of like a flute [SPK2]: The flute? [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: hmm Not really [SPK2]: Is it a wind instrument? [MOD]: not really. It's something that you would find in all sorts of you know even in in live concert really [SPK2]: Pe percussion? [SPK1]: it dr yeah [MOD]: Nope. [MOD]: Sonething very basic that allows you to you that gives you the rhythm. [SPK1]: The rhythm. [SPK2]: The rhythm? hmm [MOD]: hmm [MOD]: You ca it's usually in the background. [MOD]: Doesn't have a prominent role [SPK1]: uh wow [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Well in a typical band you could have [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: guit a r, drums [SPK1]: keyboard yeah [MOD]: That's it. [SPK1]: oh the drums [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: ok? So what would be your ranking then? [SPK1]: f violin like we both [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: thought that fi rst [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: yeah f w [SPK1]: I don't know it's hard to say between drums and cello [SPK2]: I'd say cello was [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: second least [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: to my mind that's what would pop in first [SPK1]: yeah we we both kind of thought like that anyway yeah. I think that would be our ranking as [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: well. [MOD]: Ok? Is that your [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: final decision, the violin, the cello and then the drum. [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: I'm happy with that [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: it see ms reasonable. [MOD]: Well done [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: that's it you found it. [SPK2]: Well [MOD]: [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: [SPK2]: Well done. [SPK1]: Good job. [MOD]: Great. [MOD]: So moving on to the third question I would like you to name something that people cut. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Possible [SPK1]: See I s [SPK2]: is bread [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: [SPK1]: Well I study like nutrition stuff so I thought a lot of things but [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: might as probably like v vegetable [MOD]: You're thinking in terms of food yes, you're very close thi [SPK1]: [MOD]: nk about a different category of food though [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Well I would think of you know of slice of bread [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: mhmm [SPK2]: or chees [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: or meat [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: That's it [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: meat. [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: Meat yeah that's one of the an wers. [SPK1]: ok meat and then [SPK2]: Eh timber? [MOD]: Nope. [SPK1]: god [MOD]: Try again. [MOD]: Think about your everyday life you know [SPK2]: Ok so [SPK2]: fingernails, toenails. [MOD]: Yeah that's a good answer but it wasn't one of the po most popular answers really. [SPK1]: Ok grass? [MOD]: Nope. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Ah people get their hair cut. [MOD]: Exactly very good [SPK1]: Yeah that's good. [MOD]: yes. [SPK2]: So it's two. [MOD]: mhmm So one more. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: It's not another food item [MOD]: No, no [SPK1]: so no it's not. [MOD]: it's not. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Oh I can't think of anything very comm [SPK1]: pa [SPK2]: on [SPK1]: like paper [SPK2]: good [MOD]: If you're in a wo excell [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: ent that's it yes. [MOD]: So what would be your ranking then? [SPK1]: Meat first I like well I go to [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: food when I thi [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: nk cutting [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: [SPK1]: but I don't know about we what [SPK2]: Yeah I think of meat first and then they ah I'd be [SPK2]: you know [SPK2]: really unsure of what would come second. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK1]: So it's [SPK2]: maybe paper would be [SPK1]: paper or [SPK2]: be a more common thing. [SPK1]: yeah [SPK1]: Paper and then hair yeah well just cause paper is kind of more everyday [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: kinf of s [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: ta [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: sk as opposed to cutting your hair [MOD]: mhmm mhmm [SPK1]: yeah but are you ok with that yeah yeah [SPK2]: yeah that soun ds fine to me [MOD]: Yes. [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: Now you didn't get this one ri ght [SPK1]: [MOD]: it was the hair first paper second and meat came third. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: If you think about the most frequently used phrase you you know most people say have a haircut right? [MOD]: It's a very frequently used word combination. I'm going to have a haircut and [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: then paper I suppose you know you if you work in an office or [MOD]: and then meat I I think [MOD]: vegetables might be a very popular answer and then you also have vegetarians who would never you know [MOD]: think about [SPK1]: use meat [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: But well done you did great and that is the end of the quiz, I hope you enjoyed it. Thanks very [SPK1]: hm yeah [MOD]: much. [SPK2]: Ok [SPK1]: Thank you. [SPK2]: well thank you. [SPK1]: Thanks very much. [MOD]: Alright.",P022,P023

[MOD]: lie that were were posed to a group of one hundred people and I would like you to guess the most popular answers to these questions. Ok? And then I will ask you to talk to each other and decide a on their ranking in terms of popularity. So for example I might ask you what are some ways in which you can carry patients in a hospital. So you [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: would probably say some things like ah an ambulance, patient's bed eh a wheelchair, ok? And then you will have to talk to each other and see what you know how would you order these items. [MOD]: Is that clear? [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: Are you ready for the first question? [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Ok. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: I would like you to tell me what are the public places where you would be more likely to get a f the flu or a cold. [MOD]: Where would you catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK1]: Ok, so we're supposed to discuss there with our partner, come up with [MOD]: Yes. [SPK1]: the answer. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: How many options you need? [MOD]: You thi need to come up with three. Yeah. [SPK1]: three ok Yeah. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: mhmm So I can think of public transports. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: The hospital. [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: You got the one. [SPK1]: the [MOD]: Hospital. [SPK1]: So Maybe a place with lot of people? who are [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: vulnerable Be a public transportation [MOD]: Can you be more specific [SPK1]: when you're saying me [MOD]: ok ns of transport? [SPK1]: [MOD]: Could you [MOD]: Give some exam ples? [SPK2]: bus for exa mple? [SPK1]: Like a a crowded bus. [SPK2]: Hm. [MOD]: Keep guessing. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: Something with bad ventilation? [SPK2]: trains [SPK1]: [SPK2]: maybe I don't know [SPK1]: Yes also so [MOD]: You're very close [SPK1]: yes so some [MOD]: yes [SPK1]: where with bad ventilation like in the theatre in [MOD]: If you stick to the means of transport you me [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: ntion some more. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Bus, train, you you've already mentioned bus and train and [SPK2]: dog run no [MOD]: no [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK1]: In a taxi? [MOD]: No try again [SPK1]: Not, not again [SPK1]: Oh at a plane [MOD]: Exactly [SPK1]: is it? yes the plane [SPK2]: The plane? [SPK1]: Yeah bad ventilation and [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: like long long time [SPK2]: yeah yeah didn't I wouldn't have [SPK1]: gathered yeah [SPK2]: thought of that actua [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: lly. [MOD]: So you have one more. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: You need to find one more. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Get sick [SPK1]: At a party in a nightclub [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: Not really [SPK1]: No no ok. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: So so it'd be some place like some place with a lot of people [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: in a like cramped space. [MOD]: Think about different ages [SPK1]: [MOD]: s [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: oh ok [MOD]: age groups. [SPK1]: Oh like in in th the s school for kids like ki ki [MOD]: Exactly. [SPK1]: dergarten [SPK2]: Ah yes, schools of course. hmm [MOD]: Schools. Ok, so you've got [SPK1]: Yeah the the creche yeah [SPK2]: makes sense. [MOD]: exactly. [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: So you have the three, alright? Schools [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: hospitals airplanes. What would be the ranking? [SPK1]: [SPK1]: It [SPK1]: doesn't matter who gets sick right? So [MOD]: You have to think what came f to most people's minds first what was the most popular answer [SPK1]: more ok so so Oh so is a pop answer ok [MOD]: Yeah it doesn't have to do with the probability of you know where would [SPK1]: Oh ok yeah oh ok [MOD]: you get [SPK2]: mhmm So it's not actually necessarily the right answer, it's [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: the most popular yeah [MOD]: Exactly, the most popular the most common answer that [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: most people gave. [SPK1]: So I think kindergarten 'd be the lowest because even us we never thought about it. [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: For now it's just either the plane or the [SPK1]: or the hospital that's the higher [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: [SPK2]: I would say the hospital because well plane I wouldn't have thought of it my self but [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Yeah so I think that does that that does agree with our discussion too so it'd be hos [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: pital [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: a [SPK2]: hm [SPK1]: plane and a the the school. [MOD]: Do you agree? [SPK2]: Yes yes [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: I'm sorry you got that wrong it's [SPK1]: Oh ok. [MOD]: the school is the first one was the fi [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: rst answer [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: right? Hospital is number two airplane is number three [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: you you were right about airplanes. [SPK1]: Maybe because [MOD]: I [SPK1]: we didn'r have have kids so we never thought bout it yeah [SPK2]: Yeah yeah exactly that's what I thought [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: exactly. [MOD]: But let's just try the second question ok, I would like you [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: to name musical instruments in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: in a symphony orchestra, I'm not symphony orchestra [SPK1]: Symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: The violin? [MOD]: Very good that's one. [SPK1]: Cello? [MOD]: Yeah. That's two, yeah. [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: This should be easy [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK2]: The thing is my English vocabulary is might not be [SPK1]: ah ok [SPK2]: as extended as a [MOD]: It's a sim ple word and it's something that you can find in all sorts of you know different kinds of music and vn even in live [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: concert. So [SPK1]: Clarinet? [MOD]: Nnnno [SPK1]: [MOD]: try again. [SPK1]: the [SPK2]: Drums? [MOD]: Sorry? [SPK2]: Drums? [MOD]: Drums. [SPK1]: Eh drums? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yes that's it [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: the drum. So what would be the right order then in terms of popularity. [SPK1]: Oh v v v Violin o pro probably the first. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: and drum I think drum would be the the last. [SPK2]: So sorry what was the second one? [SPK1]: So [SPK2]: what was that [SPK1]: violin and cello and drums. [SPK2]: cello yeah. [SPK2]: uh-huh Yeah. [SPK2]: [MOD]: What do you think? [SPK1]: [SPK1]: I would say [MOD]: Do you agree? [SPK1]: violin cause you cou because [SPK2]: hmm honestly I don't have a strong opinion about that [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: I don't know what would people think about that yeah. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: Yeah I a I agree why not ah but I'm [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: not convinced [MOD]: Ok. [SPK2]: but why not I mean I don't have [MOD]: ok [SPK2]: more better ideas [MOD]: right? So that's the right ranking, well done. [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: Yes [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: It's violin [SPK2]: Oh! [MOD]: cello and drum alright? [SPK1]: and drums ok. [MOD]: Very good. [MOD]: Now I would like you to think about things that people cut. Name something that people cut. [SPK1]: Cut their own fingers. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Ah it depends because cut can have many meanings [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: actually. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: I for some reasons a first I that came to my mind was a queue cutting in a queue. But it's it's probably not [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: the I [SPK1]: [SPK2]: mean it's not the literal meaning [MOD]: Let's think about the literal meaning of [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: the wo rd [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: ok? [SPK1]: cut [MOD]: Not a metaphorical sense. [SPK1]: Ok, vegetables? [MOD]: hmm you're thinking about food. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Think about a different category of food. [SPK1]: Meat? [MOD]: Excellent that's it [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: yeas, very good. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Are we still with food or [MOD]: No, let's move away from food now [SPK1]: no no we move ok [MOD]: [SPK1]: So we have the meat So people don't think [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: about vegetable at all? Like [MOD]: Not really it's the meat that came yeah. [SPK1]: Ok that's hmm Ok like when when you cut it like we cut it [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: like chopping as we ususally say vegetables. [MOD]: Yes, because some people tend to be vegetari ans so they wouldn't [SPK1]: oh yeah [MOD]: think about meat [SPK1]: oh yeah yeah [MOD]: right? [SPK1]: cut [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: Wood? [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: like like stacks of wood no? like [SPK1]: [MOD]: There is something related to wood [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Eh hair. No? [MOD]: Sorry? [SPK2]: Hair. [MOD]: Excellent, yes yes. [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: So you need one more. [SPK1]: Meat, hair and [SPK1]: cu t [SPK1]: Paper? [MOD]: Very good so you have the [SPK1]: Ok ok. [MOD]: three now, what would be your ranking?. [SPK1]: I think paper be more common to cut paper paper paper or hair? [SPK2]: paper [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Actually I would think paper, meat but I don't know. [SPK1]: ok. s so probably paper meat and hair [SPK2]: yes [SPK1]: Ok. Paper, meat and hair? [MOD]: No. [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: I'm afraid you got it wrong this time, it was actually hair first [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: Hair first! [MOD]: paper is next [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: and the last one was meat. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Probably because I don't know it's you know very frequently used word combination haircut. Haircut it's the standa [SPK1]: ok ok. [MOD]: rd word combination isn't it? [MOD]: So but yes I mean you did very well and that is the end of the quiz. I hope you enjoyed it [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: thank you very much. [SPK2]: Ok. Thank you. [SPK1]: Ok. ",P024,P025

[SPK1]: jesus [SPK2]: How should I know? [SPK1]: [MOD]: So these are the three answers [SPK1]: Oh very good. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: So [SPK1]: how do we rank them? [SPK2]: Maybe hair [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: What do you think? [SPK1]: [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: But I'm not [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: hundred per cent sure. [SPK1]: Yeah me [SPK2]: so we have hair, paper [SPK1]: neither cause we didn't think of that at first [SPK2]: yes [SPK1]: yeah. [SPK2]: yes so we have hair, paper and meat. [SPK2]: Hair, paper and meat. [SPK2]: So let's I have a very scientific approach let's [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: rank them alphabetically. [SPK2]: Hair, meat, paper. [MOD]: [SPK1]: it's like it's like stone, scissors, pa [SPK2]: [SPK1]: oh [SPK2]: or maybe paper is a [SPK2]: Yeah maybe paper is more than meat what do you think? [SPK1]: paper it's more than it covers meat yeah so it could be [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: paper [SPK2]: the answer [SPK1]: meat well le let's go with what we found, so meat would be the first one then paper and hair. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: But that's probably not [MOD]: Are you sure? [SPK1]: Is that our final answer? No we're not of course we're not. [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: I just I don't know. I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is cutting food so [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: but it could be [SPK1]: ahm [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: you know [SPK1]: I don't know to eat. [SPK2]: No let's let's go with meat then [SPK2]: maybe hair and paper? [SPK2]: because we tried other way and it didn't work [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: We're just kind of reading her verbal ah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: non-verbal commnunication ah ok so meat [SPK2]: But I'm not very confident really I [SPK1]: not me I'm not confident [MOD]: [SPK1]: I'm [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: super uncon [SPK2]: fident [MOD]: [SPK1]: We're just trying things out there. [SPK2]: it's a very important decision so I think [SPK1]: It is it is ok so meat [SPK2]: e e [SPK1]: first [SPK2]: meat, hair and paper [SPK1]: Meat, hair, paper. [MOD]: Ok, I'm sorry. [SPK1]: Oh! [MOD]: The first one is hair [SPK1]: [MOD]: then it's paper and then it's meat. [SPK2]: Oh we did it [SPK1]: [MOD]: But you did gr [SPK2]: totally wrong. [MOD]: eat now come on, you found all of them. Well done. [SPK1]: You know these people that say hair are vain, I'm just gonna put it out there, cause that's all they think about, I think about [MOD]: [SPK1]: food, which is most important [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: so I think we win. [MOD]: Well done. [SPK1]: [MOD]: I hope you enjoyed that and thanks for [SPK1]: Yeah we did. [MOD]: coming again [SPK1]: Thank you. [SPK2]: Ok. ",P030,P031
S17,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.4,"[MOD]: Hello guys, thanks very much for being here today. Eh we're going to play a quiz. So I'm going to ask you three survey questions that were previously posed to a grip group of hundred people. So you'll have to come with the three most popular answers. [MOD]: You need to colla [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: borate, you need to talk to each other and then you'll have to rank those answers. [MOD]: Ok? [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Are you ready or would you like an example or what do you feel? You're ready for the first question or [SPK2]: Sure go yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah. Go ahead. [MOD]: Yeah? [MOD]: So can you name a public place where it's more likely for someone to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: Three most common places. [MOD]: m hmm [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: Public transport I'd [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: say. [SPK2]: Public transport [SPK1]: Do we have to be more specific [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: or [MOD]: It's better yeah. [SPK1]: ok better ok [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Restaurants maybe o r [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: hm [SPK2]: Hospitals? [SPK1]: Hospitals for sure. School [SPK2]: Ah may be not because like they have [SPK1]: hm Yeah the thing is that [SPK2]: yeah, it's very sterile. [SPK1]: they say that when you [MOD]: [SPK1]: catch a bug in the hospital it's evry very strong because it has [SPK2]: so [SPK1]: survived from so many antibiotics and stuff so [SPK2]: yeah so ok [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: yeah maybe that's probably on of them like [SPK1]: o k and [SPK1]: We have so restaurants [SPK1]: hospitals [SPK2]: hospitals [SPK1]: and public trans [SPK2]: public transport [SPK1]: port [SPK1]: yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Can you be a bit more specific about public transport? [SPK2]: Buses may [SPK1]: buses [SPK2]: or [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: I'd say bu ses [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: I always feel like it's [MOD]: Ok you're doing great you found one. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: o ok great [MOD]: which is the hospital [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Alright. [MOD]: Ok? So maybe you can think more about different age groups like chil [SPK2]: Oh! [MOD]: dren for ex ample. [SPK2]: schools [SPK1]: Schools for [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: sure. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Very good. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: School [MOD]: And think about traveling. [SPK2]: Airplanes. [SPK1]: Airplanes as well yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Ok airports and yeah air port. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: So, what are your three answers? [SPK1]: Ok so hospitals [SPK2]: So hospital school [SPK1]: school [SPK1]: and [SPK2]: and [SPK1]: We can go for airplane. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Ok that's great. These are [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: the three answers. And can you rank them please? [SPK1]: Ok so which one was the most popular. [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: hm [SPK2]: Schools I'd [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: say would be pretty poular. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: I don't know. [SPK1]: Yeah I think [SPK1]: that would be the most popular I'm not sure if [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: it's the m m most correct yeah bu t [SPK2]: but it's it is yeah yeah I know I'm not sure either yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: and [SPK2]: hm [SPK1]: then I'd say [SPK2]: I'd say a lot of k [SPK1]: airplanes [SPK2]: like kids get sick a lot so [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: like I would say [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: s like [SPK1]: s [SPK2]: schools would probably be number [SPK1]: schools? Schools. [SPK2]: one [SPK1]: Number one ok. [SPK2]: and [SPK1]: and [SPK2]: the n [SPK1]: the n [SPK2]: Maybe [SPK2]: Maybe airplanes I'd say and then maybe [SPK2]: hospitals that's probably what I would say but [SPK1]: Schools, airplanes, hospitals, ok. [SPK1]: Yeah I think [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: I think I'll agree. [SPK2]: Cool. [MOD]: Almost there. [SPK1]: Al right [SPK2]: Oh [MOD]: So it was school then [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: hospital and then plane. [SPK1]: and then ok [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: But you did great guys [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: well done . [SPK1]: [MOD]: Are you ready for the second one? [SPK1]: yes [SPK2]: yep [SPK1]: s [MOD]: Can you name an instrument you can find in a [MOD]: symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Flute? [SPK2]: Violin? [SPK2]: Oh we want the three most common aswers [MOD]: mhmm [SPK2]: to that. ok. [SPK1]: Alright. [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: Violin I think it's a good [SPK2]: violin [SPK1]: option yeah. [SPK2]: Maybe cello? [SPK2]: Yes. [SPK1]: Bass [SPK2]: [SPK1]: co c th the big one bass double bass yeah [SPK2]: double bass double bass yeah [SPK1]: alright [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I wouldn't say that's one of the most popular th ones though I'd say violin and cello would probably be pretty po [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: pular and the n [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Probably flute after that I'd say [SPK1]: Flute. [SPK1]: No, from her reaction flute was not one of [SPK2]: [SPK1]: them [SPK2]: [MOD]: I'm trying [SPK2]: Oh really? [MOD]: I'm trying not to show too much now. [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: But I have to say you found two [SPK1]: [MOD]: already. [SPK1]: Ok Can you tell us [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: which one, no you can't [MOD]: Ok well look it's the violin and cello. [SPK1]: Alright [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: So you have a third one. [SPK1]: perfect. [MOD]: Which might be [SPK2]: A third one. [MOD]: very different from the other two. [SPK2]: So maybe a woodwind or [SPK2]: [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Could you help in any way or not? [MOD]: t it's very different from the other two. [SPK1]: Alright. [MOD]: And maybe no [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: strings. [SPK2]: Ok, no strings. [SPK1]: No strings. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Like something with percussion or? [MOD]: Could be. [SPK2]: Timpani? or [MOD]: [SPK2]: Maybe piano? [SPK2]: But it's not they're not usually [SPK1]: y yea h [SPK2]: used in orchestras [SPK2]: hm without strings. [SPK2]: Is it with wood like wind? [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Maybe trumpet? [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: No. [SPK2]: Not trumpet. [MOD]: It's not trumpet. No. [SPK2]: hm [SPK1]: Clarinet? [MOD]: No. [SPK1]: No it's different from the other two you said. [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Harp? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: No? [MOD]: No. [SPK1]: No. [SPK1]: [MOD]: No this is a diffi [SPK2]: Trombone? [MOD]: cult one actually the the this question I think it's difficult. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Oboe? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [MOD]: No. [SPK1]: I said [SPK2]: [SPK1]: something not common [SPK2]: let's see [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Viola? [MOD]: No. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So you have [SPK2]: I'm trying to stick to the layout of the orchestra now. [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: You have vio [SPK2]: [MOD]: lin you have cello [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: and the last one [SPK1]: violin cello [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Trumpet? [SPK2]: We've alr no. [SPK1]: Saxophone you said trump no . [SPK2]: Trombone? [MOD]: You need to [SPK2]: Tuba? [MOD]: come up with the last one. [SPK1]: No? [SPK2]: Oh we need to come up with the last one. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: yes. [SPK1]: Otherwise this would never end. [SPK2]: it could go forever hm [SPK1]: hm [SPK2]: [MOD]: No strings [SPK2]: No strings. [MOD]: very different from the [SPK1]: Is it f [MOD]: other two. [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: No you don't use your [SPK2]: you don't use your mouth [MOD]: mouth No. [SPK1]: alr ight [SPK2]: You don't use your mouth ok. [SPK1]: So I believe it's something [SPK2]: Do you hit it? [SPK1]: Yeah s I thi I but [MOD]: So think of an instrument that you might hit it yeah. [SPK2]: You might hit it. [SPK2]: the drums? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: in a s [MOD]: It's the drum. [SPK2]: Oh ok. I I did say [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: tim [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: timpani before which [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: is I [MOD]: oh [SPK2]: ok I know [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: it's ok yeah. [MOD]: So can you [SPK1]: Alright. [MOD]: rank them now? [SPK2]: Violin. [SPK1]: Ok. Violin. [SPK1]: Then cello [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: and then drum [SPK2]: then drums yeah. [MOD]: Yeah? You both agree on that? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Yes. [MOD]: That's correct [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: well done guys. [MOD]: So we have the third question which is the last one. [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: Can you name something that people cut? [SPK1]: Vegetables. [SPK2]: Bread? [SPK1]: Not neither of them is correct I feel. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: You have to work toge [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: ther you need to come up [SPK2]: Top three things [MOD]: with this together Don't look at me now for the answers. [SPK1]: Smoking?

[SPK2]: hm Meat yeah. [SPK2]: That would probably be pretty high up there I'd say. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: And the n [SPK2]: [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: Think of something both men and women cut. And maybe [MOD]: men cut it more often. [SPK2]: Wood. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: No? [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: Chopping wood? Like the [SPK1]: [SPK2]: No ok. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Men and women cut.

[MOD]: You say [MOD]: Can you cut a [SPK2]: Grass? [MOD]: piece of [SPK2]: Grass maybe? [MOD]: hm [SPK2]: No? [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: What do you think? [SPK1]: So you said you [SPK1]: can you repeat?

So I'm going to ask you three survey questions that were previously posed to a group of hundred people [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: So for each question you have to give me the three most popular answers. You have to talk to each other, you need to work together and you will have to order these answers in terms of popularity. [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Is it clear or do you want me to give you an example? No, you're fine? [SPK2]: No [MOD]: eh? first question? [SPK1]: We think yeah [SPK2]: We think yeah [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK2]: Yeah go ahead. [MOD]: Can you name a public place where it's likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: and we three w you'll give us three options? [MOD]: No you [SPK2]: or [MOD]: have to give me the answers yeah. [SPK2]: ah three options [SPK1]: An airplane? [MOD]: You have to discuss [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: with each other yeah [SPK2]: ok cold the airplane and there maybe the [SPK2]: the airport is more [SPK1]: bus [SPK2]: ba yes [SPK1]: airport yes bus [SPK2]: bus [SPK1]: train [SPK2]: train yes in general hospital [SPK1]: nursery school [SPK2]: nursery school ha most definitely so yeah nursery school is I think [SPK2]: the the th th th the guys are immune p possibly after [MOD]: hm [SPK2]: a certain age so it doesn't so yeah the airport I think is the first because you know they have all these measures when some diseases are [SPK1]: yeah yeah yeah yeah [SPK2]: spread. [SPK1]: So airport? [SPK2]: Airport, I would go for airport number one [SPK1]: number two? [SPK2]: if you agree. [SPK2]: number two [SPK2]: eh [SPK2]: Bus? [SPK1]: Bus? [SPK2]: eh [SPK2]: number three let's go to not again transport, something else, let's think of something else [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: How about [SPK2]: catch a cold [SPK2]: Hospital? [SPK1]: Hospital yeah. [SPK2]: yeah well Ok hospital is number three. [MOD]: Ok you're doing very well. You found [MOD]: hospital Can you try a little bit more with [MOD]: traveling? It's not [MOD]: the airport, it might be a means of transport [SPK2]: hmm ok [SPK2]: So the airplane. [SPK2]: air [SPK1]: airplane yeah [MOD]: You agree? [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: So you have eh plane [SPK2]: umhm [MOD]: hospital and which is the third one? [SPK2]: bus we said [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: no [MOD]: you've [SPK1]: so [MOD]: mentioned it before [SPK1]: Train? [SPK1]: No, nursery school? [MOD]: It's the school. [SPK2]: nursery school [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: [SPK2]: school yeah [MOD]: Can you rank them please? [SPK2]: Sorry? Can we? [MOD]: Can you order them? in terms [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: of popularity, which one you think comes for first? [SPK1]: So firs one would be hospit al [SPK2]: hospital I would say yeah uhm [SPK1]: second one would be [SPK2]: nursery and fourth and [SPK1]: school and third would be [SPK2]: third school [SPK1]: the airplane [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: Almost there [SPK2]: ah so we're going to swap I suppose [MOD]: ehm [SPK2]: the nursery with the plane right? [MOD]: the first [SPK2]: nursery [MOD]: one is school yeah the se [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: cond is [SPK2]: nurs [MOD]: hospital [SPK2]: hospital [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: eh [MOD]: and third is [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: plane [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: But well done yeah? [SPK2]: eh it took us some time I suppose [MOD]: No no you're [SPK1]: yeah yeah yeah [MOD]: doing fine, you're doing fine [MOD]: So the second one. Can you name an instrument you can find in a symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: An instrument yeah ah [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: ah pro pro probably this is a language issue now can't can't tell you in Greek [SPK1]: Ok, first there's the violin [SPK2]: Yeah violin is a common one I suppose and also [SPK1]: second one is a [SPK2]: now there's the big ones [SPK1]: the cello? [SPK2]: that cello is a I think cello is yet another type of [SPK1]: yeah but probably it's popular. [SPK2]: yeah it yeah violin yeah both of them are popular. And the other ones thAt don't know how they call then trombonia [SPK1]: trum trumpet or [SPK2]: trumpet [SPK1]: trombone [SPK2]: trumpet or the other [SPK1]: Ok, so we'll go for violin, cello and trombone [SPK2]: trum yeah agreed [MOD]: Ok you've found two answers which are violin and cello [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: ok ok [MOD]: so maybe you can give [SPK2]: and [MOD]: it another go? [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: It's a very different instrument [MOD]: to the ones mentioned already. [SPK2]: so the dishes no [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: A drum? [SPK2]: drum [MOD]: You agree both of you? [SPK2]: yeah yeah [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: yeah it can be the drum [MOD]: yeah it's the drum, well done! And can you order now the answers please? [SPK1]: ah [SPK2]: eh violin might be right one that comes out of your [SPK1]: violin first [SPK2]: mind directly yeah violin first drums and cello. [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: You agree? [SPK1]: We'll go with it yeah we'll go with it.

[MOD]: [SPK1]: Should be safe to be in a hospital [SPK2]: Yeah if oh but that i [SPK1]: because they clean all the time that you're in contact with sick people. [SPK1]: So I I think school is the easiest becase for kids lik kids get it easier. [SPK2]: ok. Yeah. [SPK1]: Well I'd say between school an a nd hospital. [SPK2]: Hospit al. [SPK1]: Choose one. [SPK2]: It could be sch I mean it could be either one really. [SPK1]: We go for hospital? [SPK2]: Let's go for hos pital? [SPK1]: We go for hospital? [MOD]: So you your answers are hospital? And then? [SPK1]: For the most popular and then a school. [MOD]: And then [SPK1]: And then plane. [SPK2]: Plane. [MOD]: You were almost there. [SPK2]: Awh was it [SPK1]: No way! [MOD]: [Now the first one is] school. [SPK2]: School so we should have like yeah exactly yeah [SPK1]: School yeah I was right. Because I [MOD]: Hospital? [SPK1]: I I think of kid s and I in my [SPK2]: You think of no but that makes perfect sense yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah and then the kids bring it home and the parents get sick and so [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: on so it's def [MOD]: Teachers [SPK1]: Teachers yeah yeah it's def [SPK2]: right so it's teachers as well that's right that's right. Yeah. [MOD]: and the third answer was plane. [SPK2]: Plane ok. [SPK1]: Yeah yeah I'd think so. [SPK2]: So we got one right. [MOD]: Ah but still ah that's good.

[SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: Is it clear? [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Are you ready for the first question? [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yeah? Can you name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK1]: Sea shore? [SPK2]: Sea shore hm. [SPK2]: So we need how many three? [MOD]: Three. [SPK2]: Three. [MOD]: Three. [SPK2]: I would go for airport. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: And now we need a third one. And actually [MOD]: it's a [SPK2]: decide which are the populars eh? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: More. [MOD]: th think about there's something connected to the airport [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: It's more like [MOD]: public transport. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: So it's not the an airport, but it's the actual [SPK2]: yyyes [SPK1]: The transport itself. [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: So public places p public transport like buses [SPK2]: public [MOD]: But which one [SPK2]: transportation in general [MOD]: which means of transport? [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: Related to the airport. [SPK1]: The bus I guess. [SPK2]: I would go for bus or some sort of metro [SPK2]: yeah. [MOD]: Somethi ng [SPK2]: You were thinking probably of the plane itself. [MOD]: Plane, that's that's one answer actually. yeah [SPK2]: Yes. [MOD]: So you need to find two more. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: So it should be like somewhere closed like [MOD]: mhmm [SPK1]: where p yeah many [MOD]: where there are many people probably [SPK1]: people [SPK2]: yes So concert hall? [SPK1]: it works good but like somewhere [SPK2]: No. Well, you can catch a cold probably at the hospotal to be ho [MOD]: Yeah [SPK2]: nest yes [MOD]: hospital is another answer actually, that's that's good. [SPK1]: Usually it happens in the kinder gartens [MOD]: yeah. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: If you got a child. [MOD]: So it's the school. [SPK1]: School ok. [MOD]: Yeah. That's great guys, so you have the three answ ers. [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: So now you need to talk to each other in order to order these answers in terms of popularity. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Well I vote for the kindergarten and school cause [SPK2]: I think [SPK1]: whenever I send my kid [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: he's always si back sick [MOD]: [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: [SPK2]: I think I will agree in the sense that p most people that have children would would say first the school. So yeah I think school is would be [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: first answer. [SPK2]: Now the other two were? [SPK1]: Hospital and the plane. [SPK2]: Hospital and the plane. [SPK2]: I would say first hospital, because most people go to hospitals unless people travel. [SPK1]: I agree with that. [SPK2]: But You agree? [SPK1]: And there's so many people like like I mean li the number increases [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: like people coming coming and giving it so [SPK1]: the number of the potential people are [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: who are sick they're increasing all the time. [SPK2]: Yes. [SPK1]: In the plane you have this like limited number [SPK2]: mhmm [SPK1]: like it's not growing it's just that fixed number. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: I guess so. [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: Other thing [SPK2]: we go we g I I agree we go with that? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I agree. [SPK2]: School hospital [SPK1]: and this plane [SPK2]: and plane. [MOD]: Brilliant, that's correct. Well done. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Very good. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Ready for the second one? [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: Can you name an instrument you can find in a symphony orchestra. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Harp? [SPK2]: You'll go for harp. [SPK1]: Since since we're in Ireland, I guess the harp is the [MOD]: [SPK1]: first [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: one that comes to mind. [MOD]: [SPK2]: I would go for for violin. [MOD]: Violin is the right one yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: And we need a third one no? [MOD]: You need two. [SPK2]: Two. [MOD]: Two more yeah. [SPK2]: Two more [SPK1]: [SPK1]: There should be definitely be [SPK1]: hmm violin [MOD]: There is another one with strings. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: The big one the big [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: one well I just can't remember [SPK2]: you can go for the cello? or the [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK1]: cello is that one ce cello cello [MOD]: is that that's correct. Very good. So you need to find one more. Which is quite different from this instrument. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: No strings. [SPK1]: I think [SPK2]: No strings. [SPK1]: something blowing? [SPK2]: Could be. That I I to be honest I don't remember if piano is considered the symphonic orchestra. no. [MOD]: No it's not. It's not in in the three answers. [SPK2]: So [SPK2]: Clarinet? [SPK2]: It's a bit not that close. [SPK1]: It's not a string so [MOD]: You might hit it. [SPK2]: Hit it? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yes. So drums [SPK1]: Drums? [MOD]: Drums yeah very good. [SPK2]: hm hmm hm [MOD]: So you have three answers. Can you order them now in terms of popularity please? [SPK1]: Violin is the first I guess. [SPK2]: Yes, probably violin would be first. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Well [SPK2]: now [SPK1]: maybe drum [SPK1]: Now I think it's drum could be more like yeah [SPK2]: more popular? [SPK1]: cause [SPK1]: I mean [SPK1]: if you s think of this way like you don't see people like mostly like playing and the violin I mean [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: there are violin players are less than the drum players [SPK2]: Yes. [SPK1]: I guess so. So, I would say the drum is the first. [SPK2]: But on the for example in the orchestra the second person in charge a after the the master is the vio the fi the first violinist [SPK1]: Ok then [SPK2]: and is also [SPK1]: if [SPK2]: on the on the front let's say of the of the orchestra and the drum is is always in the [SPK1]: Yeah in the [SPK2]: back. So, in that sense probably people would associate violin with the picture of an orchestra playing. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK1]: But then the cello is always in this middle in the centre since it's big one [SPK2]: yes [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: and and and and yeah I have I don't have deep knowledge of that [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ah ok [SPK1]: of the music stuff you know . [SPK2]: So we fix violin first? [SPK1]: ok but [SPK2]: and and discuss which goes second is cello or the or the drum? [SPK1]: Well, I I support your point that that drums are always in the back [SPK2]: yes [SPK1]: I think that makes a sense to put even the third place [SPK2]: The third place. [SPK1]: Makes a sense to me. [SPK2]: So you go for violin, cello, drum. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I see why why cello why wh drum is not first, a at least in my opinion, but I would go for violin drum and and then cello. [SPK1]: Ah [SPK2]: Because ok somehow you have the violin that it should be there because it's the it's the it's the boss after the the maestro but then what you always assume that is there is some sort of rhythm. So, the second thing that you would say a as far as I think would be drum. That definitely there should there should be drum there. And then the cello I think le ll least the least people would think of cello. [SPK1]: Yeah I I would rely on your opinion cause I have this as I don't have the deep knowledge of that. [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: I mean I love music especially the classical music but I never pay attention on how they how they are [MOD]: yeah exactly it's difficult. Yeah. [SPK1]: I just love it I just love to listen. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: and give attention there. [SPK2]: So we we go with this ordering? eh [SPK1]: I oh I agree with that why not. [MOD]: Almost right [SPK2]: Almost [MOD]: almost. [SPK2]: right [MOD]: So violin is first [SPK2]: Mhmm. [MOD]: Then it's cello and then is drum. [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: But you did well, you almost found it. [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Ready [MOD]: ready for the last one? [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: Yeah. Yeah. [MOD]: Can you name something that people cut. [SPK1]: Well, if you think of this straight like not abs abstract thing [SPK2]: hm [SPK1]: cut the paper [MOD]: Paper is right actually. [SPK1]: or cut the crap [MOD]: [SPK1]: if it's something else [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: m no we need something more tangible [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: but yeah pa [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: per is one yeah. [SPK1]: yeah. [SPK2]: I thought of bread to be honest I o [SPK2]: The third I thought wa was veins. actually [MOD]: [SPK2]: but let's go for bread. [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: Let's go for bread. [SPK1]: Ok. They cut and [MOD]: ts [SPK1]: they slice the [SPK2]: I hope ths was not the popular answer. [MOD]: It's not bread but it's something related to food. [SPK2]: food [MOD]: So [SPK1]: Cheese. [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: What they cut? [SPK2]: hm [MOD]: It's like a main ingredient. [SPK2]: Probably meat. [MOD]: Meat, that's correct. [SPK2]: Yes. [MOD]: Very good. So now you have one last answer left, you have to find another one. [SPK1]: So paper [SPK2]: So up to now paper, meat [SPK1]: What they can [SPK1]: it's a tangible, right? It's like straight away and so [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: What people [MOD]: And think of appearance for example, what would both [SPK1]: Hair? [MOD]: men and women, yeah. [SPK2]: Ah, hair. Hair. [SPK1]: Hair. [MOD]: That's great. So you have [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: all three answers. Can you order them now in terms of popularity? [SPK1]: I say this way pa meat, hair and k paper. [SPK1]: so [SPK1]: like [SPK1]: if you are not a vegetarian you would cut meat everyday. [MOD]: [SPK2]: hm [SPK1]: I'm not a vegetarian. [SPK2]: So you well meat hair and eh pa [SPK1]: paper [SPK2]: per [SPK1]: Oh in this digital world you don't cut the paper so much. [SPK2]: Yeah yeah. [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: I'll just think of new things so. [SPK2]: I thhhhhink I would [SPK2]: I I would go for haircut fir hair cut first because haircut is a very common word so I think that although we for us it took time to to think of hair [SPK2]: it it it's some thought that most people would do directly this cut this association of cut and haircut. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: But I'm not sure. The thing there is also the word papercut to describe it when you get cut by by a paper, so I w even if somebody would say mention the word cut you might may consider the association with papercut. [SPK1]: Which is cutting the paper itself? Not, being cut with the paper. [SPK2]: Yes. [SPK2]: But then [SPK1]: Well [SPK1]: And I as a as I'm not a vegetarian I as I the meat I cut the meat every day [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: so for me that stands for first I'm not stylish [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: I don't go to the barber everyday [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: so [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: ah yeah [SPK1]: once a month maybe [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: twi w t t once in a month [SPK2]: so we we fix it like meat hair and [SPK1]: Well, I can dis we can discuss about the th hair and the paper but I th I I would put the meat [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: I mean of the [SPK2]: oh yeah [SPK1]: three I would put the meat in the first place. [SPK2]: You have some reason to believe that paper would be more popular than hair? Ok. [SPK1]: No, I just want [SPK2]: Ah, ah. [SPK1]: ch to discuss if you have d if you disagree with. [SPK2]: Ah oh no. No, I think then we can go for meat , hair and then paper. [SPK1]: Ok. Ok. Works for me. [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: No? [MOD]: Almost there, first is hair [SPK1]: [MOD]: then it's paper then it's meat. [SPK2]: Last is meat [MOD]: Last yeah. [SPK2]: eh yeah. [MOD]: But that's [SPK1]: But I guess [MOD]: very interesting the thinking process you know? [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: But I think the most few people they're maybe they were like females [MOD]: [SPK1]: their haircuts [MOD]: [SPK1]: does in the fir rst place [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: I think. [MOD]: It was a random sample, I don't know more about it. But [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: it's very interesting ah? [SPK1]: [MOD]: Your thinking process was very intere sting. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Ok well done guys. Thanks very much I hope you [SPK2]: Ok, thanks. [MOD]: enjoyed it. [SPK1]: Thanks. ",P044,P045
S22,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4,3.6,"[MOD]: Ah it's fine. Hello guys. Thanks very much for being here today. [MOD]: We're going to play a quiz. [MOD]: I'm going to ask you three questions that were previously posed to a group of hundred people. You'll have to find the three most popular answers [MOD]: and then you need to talk to each other, you need to collaborate in order to order these answers in terms of popularity. [MOD]: Is it cl [SPK1]: ok. [MOD]: ear? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Ready to start? [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: So the first question is name a public place [MOD]: where you're likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: A cold or a flu bug? [SPK2]: I guess a hospital is the [MOD]: That's correc [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: t. Very good. [SPK2]: obvious one. [SPK1]: A hospital [SPK1]: Somewhere else you gonna be [SPK2]: Public [SPK1]: around [SPK2]: place [SPK1]: sick people, around lots of people in and in close proximi [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: ty then. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Probably college, a lecture maybe? [MOD]: yeah You're ve ry close in that th [SPK2]: Or close [MOD]: is [SPK2]: Classroom? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Ye ah. [MOD]: So it's [SPK1]: Oh with kids an and unhygienic [MOD]: So it's [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK1]: A school? [MOD]: A school yeah very good. [SPK2]: So a school ok. [SPK1]: ok. [MOD]: So you have two. [MOD]: You need one more. [SPK2]: Two of the to [MOD]: Yeah yeah yeah yeah. [SPK2]: p three? Ok. Oh we're doing fairly [SPK1]: Awh good. [MOD]: [You're] doing grea [SPK1]: So nice. [MOD]: doing well. [SPK2]: t. Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK1]: Somewhere that's gonna be dirty? [SPK1]: Somewhere there's lots of germs arou nd s [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: o [MOD]: Think about travelling. [SPK1]: A train? [SPK1]: A bus? [SPK2]: Plane? [MOD]: Plane. Yeah. Very good. [SPK1]: Awh cause it's very Yeah. [MOD]: So you have all three answers. [SPK2]: O k. [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: So you need to order them now in terms of [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: popularity. [SPK1]: I would say [SPK2]: I'd say we probably got it righ t. [SPK1]: Yeah [SPK2]: Ah [SPK1]: I'd say a hospital would spr ing to mi [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: nd first. [SPK2]: And then what do you think? Classroom next? [MOD]: A sch ool [SPK2]: Or School sorry. [SPK1]: Eh yeah I'd I'd go with the order that we ha d. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Are you sure? [SPK2]: [MOD]: Are you read [SPK1]: I [MOD]: y you re [SPK2]: If it's a [MOD]: [SPK1]: I'm co I reckon a hospital and then the other two could go one way or the other. [SPK2]: Yeah could go either way but [SPK1]: But I'd be I'd be [SPK2]: If that's the way we wen [SPK1]: Yeah yeah exactly. [SPK2]: t in ours but probably [MOD]: So hos [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: pital first then? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Then [SPK2]: Then [SPK1]: school then aeroplane. [MOD]: You're almost there guys. School was the first one. [SPK1]: Oh [SPK2]: Alright [MOD]: Yeah [SPK1]: [MOD]: there was school, h ospita [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: l and then airplane. [MOD]: But you did [SPK2]: That's alright. [MOD]: very well now. [SPK1]: We did ok. [SPK2]: Yeah I'd I in fairness I think we were more correct than that h undred hundred people you asked [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [MOD]: No but they it's not that they are wrong you know it's just the most popular [MOD]: answer. [SPK2]: Ah then they're definitel [MOD]: [SPK2]: y wrong. [MOD]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: Are you ready for the second one? Yeah? [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Can you name an instrument in a symphony orchestra? [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: What do they play in a symphony orchestra? [SPK2]: I I've first think stringed instruments and then [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: very most commonly be violin I would think? [MOD]: That's great. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Yeah. [MOD]: Violin's [SPK2]: [MOD]: one of the answers. [SPK1]: Would they play a cello? [SPK2]: Yeah cello [MOD]: Perfect yeah you have two. [SPK2]: I thought of as well so. Brilliant [SPK1]: [SPK2]: cello. [MOD]: So there is one more. [SPK1]: Violin, a cello [MOD]: No strings this time. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: No strings. [MOD]: No. [SPK1]: And is a sym phony. [MOD]: For the la st one. [SPK2]: I'm trying to think what's probably the most What jumps out when you think symphony orchestra? [SPK1]: Y your [SPK2]: Y yes. [SPK1]: man at the front. [SPK1]: Or your woman at the fro [SPK2]: The conductor? [MOD]: [The con] ductor yeah. [SPK1]: nt the conduct or and then everyone's sat down [SPK1]: playing a [laugh-] violin [-laugh] and he's playing their c [SPK2]: [SPK1]: ellos. [SPK2]: I think it might be percussion might come up as well [MOD]: Can you be [SPK2]: so [MOD]: more speci fic [SPK2]: mayb e cymbals? [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: Or drums [MOD]: Yeah dr [SPK2]: of some kind? [MOD]: ums. [SPK1]: Drum [MOD]: Yeah very good! [SPK1]: s ok drums. [MOD]: So you have three answers. Can you rank them please? [SPK2]: hmm do we trust ourselves a gain? [SPK1]: [SPK1]: I reckon [SPK1]: everyone thinks stringed instrument [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: and so violin would come out top. [SPK2]: Could be cello top though? I'm not su [SPK1]: Do you reckon? [SPK2]: re. [SPK2]: Cell [SPK1]: To be fair [SPK2]: oh [SPK1]: cell I I had cell [SPK2]: You cause you had cello first. [SPK1]: o in my h ead before I had [SPK2]: Yeah yeah. [SPK1]: violin. [SPK2]: Let's try let's go cello first maybe. [SPK1]: Ok and then [SPK2]: Then violin? [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Yeah? And then what? The drums wa [SPK1]: And then drums. [SPK2]: s the third one we had. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: You were very close again [SPK1]: [MOD]: guys first [SPK1]: [MOD]: is violin then cello and then [SPK2]: [MOD]: drum [SPK1]: Always. [SPK2]: We were close. [MOD]: [MOD]: Third question? [SPK1]: Yep. [MOD]: Yeah? [MOD]: Name something that people cut. [SPK1]: People cut Fruit? [MOD]: Cut yeah. [MOD]: Bit more specific. [SPK1]: An [SPK2]: An apple? [SPK1]: An apple. [MOD]: [SPK2]: cut [SPK1]: People cut. [SPK2]: Alright so type of fruit people cut. [MOD]: It's not fruit. [SPK2]: ok not fruit. [SPK1]: Vegetables? [SPK2]: Carrots? [SPK1]: Food? [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK2]: B read. [MOD]: More specific it's not bread no. [SPK2]: hmm were these Irish people you asked? [SPK1]: Onions? [MOD]: [SPK2]: Potatoes? [SPK1]: Potatoes. [SPK2]: [MOD]: [MOD]: No. [MOD]: It's not vegetables. [SPK1]: It's not vegetables. [MOD]: No. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: And it might be more specific than fruit. [MOD]: Than food. [SPK1]: Than food oh. [SPK2]: Than food? [SPK1]: So it is a food? [SPK2]: [SPK2]: God. [SPK1]: And it's not a vegetable. [MOD]: No. [MOD]: It's the opposite actually. [SPK2]: The opposite of ve [MOD]: [SPK2]: getable? [MOD]: If you're a vegetarian like think of what you would [SPK1]: Meat? [MOD]: Meat. Yeah. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: That's correct. [SPK1]: Is it just Oh right yeah. [SPK2]: Oh ok Meat. [MOD]: yeah [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So you have two m [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: ore. You have to find two more answers. [SPK2]: What things pe [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ople cut. [MOD]: They don't have to do now with food. [SPK1]: With scissors you'd cut things. [SPK1]: Paper? [SPK2]: So you'd [SPK1]: Pape r. [MOD]: Yeah. Great. Yeah. So one more. [SPK1]: What else would you cut? [SPK2]: Hair maybe? [SPK1]: Yes that's [MOD]: Yea h. correct. Well done. [SPK1]: Good shot. [SPK2]: I have a super efficient at this. [MOD]: Really? So can you order them now please in terms of popu [SPK1]: Right. [MOD]: larity agai [SPK1]: Mea [MOD]: n? [SPK1]: t, [SPK1]: paper, hair. [SPK2]: Yea h. [SPK2]: Maybe. [SPK1]: Cutting meat doesn't [SPK2]: Hair [SPK1]: strike string spring to mind [SPK2]: I did think food straight away though. [SPK1]: Ye ah. [SPK2]: So [SPK2]: hmm [SPK1]: And not many people [SPK1]: well not many people actually cut hair. [SPK2]: Yeah maybe hair would be third. [SPK1]: But then who cut [SPK2]: But every time we've [SPK1]: s paper either? [MOD]: [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: I'd say meat [SPK2]: paper, hair maybe? [SPK1]: Meat, paper, hair? [SPK2]: We've been wrong with the order every time so far so [MOD]: [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: [SPK1]: Why not [SPK2]: [MOD]: Never know now. [SPK1]: meat, paper, hair. [MOD]: Yeah? [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Do you [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: agree? [SPK1]: Yeah why not? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Yeah. [MOD]: Almost th ere guys. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Hair is the most pop ular answer. [SPK2]: Alright. [MOD]: Yeah h [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: it's hair, paper and meat. [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: But well done guys like you found all the an swers. [SPK2]: We did pretty well now. [MOD]: I hope [SPK1]: Yeah [MOD]: you enjoyed it. Thanks very much f [SPK1]: Is that [MOD]: or coming. That's it. [SPK1]: Oh.",P046,P047
S23,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.6,3.4,"[SPK2]: set [MOD]: So hi guys thanks [SPK1]: hi [MOD]: very much for coming here today. We are going to play a quiz. So I'm going to ask you three questions that were previously posed to a group of hundred people. You have to find the three most famous answers to each question. You have to talk to each other you have to collaborate in order to order these answers then eh in terms of popularity. [SPK1]: mhmm [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: Ready to start? [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: Yeah? [MOD]: So the first question name a public place where you're likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: w w who who was asked this like what's the public where was it? [MOD]: It was just a random sample but I think Maria can give you more information yeah. [SPK2]: ok ok [SPK1]: So we're just trying to figure out the answers [MOD]: yeah [SPK1]: they people might have come up with? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: So what's [MOD]: three [SPK2]: the question again? [MOD]: name a place where you're more likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. And you need to get three answers [SPK1]: in general [MOD]: yeah. [SPK1]: ehm [SPK2]: It's very broad. [SPK1]: I suppose the ob obvious one would be the hospital would it be? [MOD]: Perfect that's one. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: That's correct. [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: [SPK2]: I would never have thought about it ok. [MOD]: [SPK2]: I'd say the beach [SPK1]: [SPK2]: but I don't think that makes any sense. [SPK1]: Beach probably's least likely cause the salt water and that's kind of an antiseptic. [SPK2]: yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ok It's windy [SPK1]: [SPK2]: the coast [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: I'm from Brazil [SPK1]: [MOD]: yeah yeah [SPK1]: the people get sick on the beach in Brazil a lot oh well then maybe it is then [SPK2]: yeah I do I do [SPK1]: [SPK2]: ok hospital catch a cold [SPK1]: but [SPK2]: [MOD]: think of different age groups maybe [SPK1]: I suppose public toilets be another [SPK2]: hmm [MOD]: hmm [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: [SPK2]: not really ok [MOD]: no [SPK2]: [MOD]: Think about children. [SPK1]: hmm yeah schools [MOD]: So where school [SPK1]: yeah schools [MOD]: very very good [SPK2]: ok ok [MOD]: So you [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: have hospital and school and you need to find the third answer.
