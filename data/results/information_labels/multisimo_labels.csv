"[MOD]: Ok so thanks for coming today. we're going to play a quiz. I would n [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: I'm going to ask you three questions and I would li [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: ke you to to that were posed to group of one hundred pend one hundred people and then I would like you to guess the three most popular answers to these questions. [SPK2]: Ok [MOD]: and then we'll ask you to identify the ranking in terms of popularity. For example if I ask you what is normally used to to transport patients in a hospital you could say th things like ambulance, a wheelchair right? A patient's bed so is that is that clear? Do you have any ques [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: tions? Nope? Ok. [MOD]: Are you ready for the first question? [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: I have yeah I have to point out that you really need to talk to each other before you make your final decisions so you nee [SPK1]: Ok. [MOD]: d to have a discussion, ok? [SPK1]: Right. [MOD]: Right. So the first question i s where in which public place would you be more likely to catch a cold or a flu bug. [SPK2]: A flu bag? [MOD]: A flu bug Sorry I'm not pronouncing [SPK2]: Oh bug ok. [MOD]: Bug [SPK2]: Sorry . [MOD]: sorry. [SPK1]: Which pu [SPK2]: Hm. [MOD]: Ex [SPK1]: blic place [MOD]: Yes. [SPK2]: ok Ok. [SPK1]: A doct [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: or's waiting room is that public? [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I guess it is yeah so that makes sense somewhere where there's just a lot of people and possibly outdoors so something like a park. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: So [SPK1]: Or a public school would they count? Are they kind of indoors? [SPK2]: Yeah actually I think a school would be better again it's real [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: close together and stuff. [SPK1]: Good. [SPK2]: [SPK2]: and I'm just thinking I've a friend who got sick lately [SPK2]: after working in a restaurant but I don't think people generally get sick in restaurants. [SPK1]: Well Depends on the kind [SPK2]: [SPK1]: of restaurant [MOD]: [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Yeah that's kinda tricky how you should it [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: As is is there are there any parameters going from it like does it have to be an open public pla ce or [MOD]: Not really. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK2]: what like [SPK1]: Maybe [SPK2]: a swimming pool be a weird answer or would it make sense? [SPK1]: Would that make infections and things like that for the m like [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: funguses and toe things and Awful stuff like that. [SPK2]: Yeah exactly. [SPK1]: Yeah that was tricky. I I'd say school because everyone is always getting sick at school. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Or anywhere you're working in close proximity to someone. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: But [SPK2]: Me too though I think the doctor's waiting room is a pretty good one [SPK2]: and then a school and then [SPK1]: Ah yeah [SPK2]: like a a bus like public transport. [SPK1]: Awh yeah Sorry I I just touched a bus on the way here and it was so slimy it was gross yeah [SPK2]: Gross [SPK1]: So a bus would be a good one. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Alright. [SPK2]: Ok we say that that's a good three [SPK1]: fair enough [SPK2]: in that case? [SPK1]: ok which is the most popular though? [SPK2]: I think [MOD]: Before you can I [SPK1]: Oh [MOD]: give you my feedback? Before [SPK1]: Yes [MOD]: you decide [SPK1]: absolutely [MOD]: do you know about the ranking very good you have the two right? So it's the [SPK1]: [MOD]: school [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: mhmm [MOD]: and then it's the next one you mentioned the doctor's waiting room can you mention something similar? [MOD]: [SPK1]: Like a hospital waiting room [MOD]: Exactly. Great. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So a hospital is the second one and [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: the third one again well done it's a means of trans port but it's not the b b the bus it's [MOD]: a different mean [SPK1]: hmm [MOD]: s of transport [SPK2]: Is it [SPK2]: Is it still public transport? [MOD]: We ll it's a means of transportation yes it i righ it is I suppose. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: [SPK2]: Are these people asked in Ireland or [SPK1]: exactly would it be the luas or [SPK2]: would it be New Yorkers saying the subway or something you know [MOD]: No it's not the subway. [SPK2]: ok [SPK2]: [SPK2]: The [SPK1]: I don't know I think it's like the bus the luas the dart [SPK2]: Yeah the train [MOD]: You're ge [SPK1]: the luas [MOD]: tting there you're very close [SPK2]: [MOD]: [SPK1]: taxis like Dublin bikes cause I don't know [SPK2]: [MOD]: Yeah but what is [SPK2]: I don't [MOD]: the one thing that Irish people love to do How [SPK1]: Complain? [MOD]: do they travel [SPK1]: Oh sorry [SPK2]: that [SPK1]: was under there [MOD]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: one of our own cars walking [SPK1]: not walking [SPK2]: it makes sen nse to say in your own car though [SPK1]: That's not public [SPK2]: but it's a public place [MOD]: When people love to escape for fo from Ireland right they want [SPK1]: Oh pla ane of course the recycled [SPK2]: Oh plane [MOD]: Excellent [SPK1]: air! and [SPK2]: Ye ah [SPK1]: Jesus [MOD]: Well done [SPK1]: So hard [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Took us long enough. [MOD]: Now that you have the three most pop ular answers would you be able to discuss the ranking then? [SPK1]: Oh god ! [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: I suppose by population the number of people that travel on planes as opposed to the people that go to school or [SPK2]: Yeah exact I think that plane might [SPK1]: doctor's waiting room [SPK2]: be the third one because it's people who like travel all the time being like oh I hate travelling getting sick on the plane [SPK1]: La di daw [SPK2]: [SPK1]: What about doctor's waiting room or hospital waiting rooms? because you're already kinda [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: sick in there. [SPK2]: Yeah exactly like where does [SPK2]: So if this is like understanding what people said [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: like your mind went to waiting room before it went [SPK1]: ah well [SPK2]: to [SPK1]: ugh it's just the super bugs and stuff yeah [SPK2]: schools yeah [SPK2]: so [SPK1]: [SPK2]: and ag gain if you seen that this is adults talking more adults have probably been to a hospital or whatever lately than [SPK1]: I [SPK2]: to a school so [SPK1]: You did tell us the order there though didn't you? [MOD]: I will give you the order at the e nd [SPK2]: [MOD]: If [SPK1]: Yeah [MOD]: you can make your final decision then I can give you mine feedback yeah. [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So what do you [SPK1]: I [MOD]: think [SPK1]: I remember you you just said it like five seconds ago and I don't remember it now [SPK2]: [SPK1]: You did the did you just say [SPK2]: I think she was just saying what they were. She didn't give the order [SPK1]: Oh I thought you said this I thought you said the third one was and the second one was but maybe it wasn't the order ok. [MOD]: No no it wasn't [SPK2]: [MOD]: the order [SPK1]: I was like darn I missed the answers [SPK2]: She was just saying what they were [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: [MOD]: Not giving you any hints now [SPK1]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: Ok so would you say [SPK1]: hos [SPK2]: I would poss ibly go hospital and then school and then plane. [SPK1]: and then plane. Grand. [SPK2]: Ok. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Is that your final decision yep? [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Final answer. [MOD]: ok now the first option is actually the school [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: You mentioned adults there but don't forget that adults have families and they have kids. [SPK2]: They do. [MOD]: So s [SPK2]: Yeah [MOD]: The school is number one hospital is number two and the airplane is number three. But [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: Great, good job, very good. [MOD]: Are you ready for the second question now? [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: Ok [MOD]: Great. [SPK1]: [MOD]: So I would like you to think about instruments what are the most popular answers to name the question of naming an instrument in an in a symphony orchestra. [SPK1]: Oh ah just name? [SPK2]: Just an orchestra. [MOD]: In a symphony orchestra [SPK2]: [MOD]: or what are the instruments [SPK1]: Violins [SPK2]: so violin yeah [SPK1]: [SPK2]: most popular one [MOD]: [SPK1]: I don't cello based o based all the other strings flutes [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: [SPK1]: I don't know a symphony orchestra. I'm terrible at those. It's just a mini orchestra [SPK2]: There was a map of [SPK2]: all the things in a symphony ochestra in my school and I'm trying to think of it [SPK1]: [SPK2]: now. [MOD]: Well you've already got the two. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Oh oh there you go. so what do I say? [MOD]: So [SPK2]: Violins and cellos is it? [MOD]: Exactly. [SPK1]: Ok. [SPK1]: as are there symbols and are those things that crash [SPK2]: [SPK1]: together? [SPK2]: Basically like a symbol or a drum or something [SPK1]: Yeah. What are those yolks called [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: with the monkeys [MOD]: You did find the third one [SPK2]: The drum? [MOD]: Yes! Exactly. [SPK2]: Yeah. [MOD]: Well done. [SPK2]: Cool. [SPK1]: There you go. [MOD]: You're very good. So [SPK2]: [MOD]: What with the right or the ranking in terms of popularity. [SPK2]: ok I think violin would be number one [SPK1]: Yeah we both came to it first [SPK2]: in a big way. [SPK1]: to it first. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Then it's cellos? [SPK1]: or drums maybe. [SPK2]: I don't know I think that was or I don't know the kinda default thing that you think of with the symphony orchestra is like duh duh duh duh duh you know that starts with like the start of [SPK1]: [SPK2]: universal [SPK1]: Yeah [SPK2]: movies you know the dun dun dun dun dun. [SPK1]: oh so the drums? [SPK2]: so people might go to drums [SPK1]: ok [SPK2]: then second I don't [SPK1]: [SPK2]: know it's just a way of thinking of it [SPK1]: maybe [SPK2]: yeah. [SPK1]: We go with that then? [SPK1]: the violin, drums, cello [SPK1]: Ok [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Think so. [MOD]: mhmm Ok? [SPK2]: Yeah [SPK1]: mhmm [MOD]: you were very fast when you had to find the three answers but I'm afraid you again don't have the right ranking. [SPK2]: [MOD]: It was the violin then the cello. [SPK1]: oh [MOD]: and the drum was the third [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: last one but good great work. [SPK1]: well we're [MOD]: good job [SPK1]: getting there [SPK2]: Yeah [MOD]: I think the third question should be very simple. So I would like you to name things that people cut. [SPK1]: Cut? [MOD]: Yeah. [SPK1]: My god their hair. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Cucumbers. [SPK2]: Vege [SPK1]: tables [SPK2]: [MOD]: You have the hair. [SPK2]: Yeah. [SPK1]: Alright. [SPK2]: Paper? [MOD]: That's one. [SPK1]: Yeah. [SPK2]: Wrapping paper or [MOD]: Excellent. [SPK2]: something [MOD]: That's the second one. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: calorie [SPK1]: s nowadays [SPK2]: [SPK1]: no? carbs [MOD]: hmm [SPK1]: [SPK2]: interest ing interpretation [SPK1]: hu I know [SPK2]: of the word cut. [SPK1]: what am I saying [SPK2]: about myself [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Sellotape? [SPK1]: Would you [SPK2]: Is it [SPK1]: or would you break sellotape with those little snazzy some people [SPK2]: things they have nowadays [SPK1]: some people [SPK2]: god are classic they go with the scissors [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: technologies really [SPK1]: screwed us [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [MOD]: You did mention [SPK2]: cheese [MOD]: vegetables Would you [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: not think of a different cate gory of food [SPK1]: fruit [SPK2]: cheese [SPK1]: [SPK2]: [SPK1]: so specific [SPK2]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: bread [SPK1]: meat, butcher [MOD]: Yes excellent [SPK2]: [MOD]: meat. [SPK2]: but I'm a vegetarian I'd never have thought of that [SPK1]: oh well that's not gonna [MOD]: Alright. [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Ok. [MOD]: So what would be the ranking then? [SPK1]: Oh what was the third one paper [MOD]: hair [SPK1]: hair oh [SPK2]: hair [SPK1]: yes hair [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: and meat. [SPK1]: and meat. Ok. [SPK2]: Oh yeah I'd been thinking hair and then you said hair Ok. [SPK1]: first [SPK2]: so it might make sense to put that number one? [SPK1]: alright [SPK2]: But [SPK1]: yep [SPK2]: again I wouldn't really know where to place meat in that cause I I'd say second [SPK1]: I don't meat is pretty popular [SPK2]: I've heard [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: [SPK2]: I guess would you say hair pa ah hair meat paper [SPK1]: I don't know maybe we could go with cut paper first. [SPK1]: I don't know. [SPK2]: I can't think of the last time [SPK1]: I haven't dealt with paper. [SPK2]: I cut pa [SPK1]: yeah [SPK2]: per yeah [SPK1]: neither can I [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: definitely got my hair cut more recently like [SPK1]: yeah [MOD]: [SPK1]: [SPK2]: Pe ople who eat meat regularly have probably cut meat more rec ently [SPK1]: pro bably [SPK2]: It's a classic dinner [SPK1]: hmm very Iri [SPK2]: ok so [SPK1]: sh [SPK2]: hair meat paper [SPK1]: ok go [SPK2]: or would [SPK1]: with that [SPK2]: meat be more popular than hair [SPK2]: do you think? [SPK1]: nah ah sure I don't know I I thought of hair first too [SPK2]: ok I think people go to hair first [SPK1]: yeah like [SPK2]: is all haircut is a word meat cut isn't [SPK1]: well in the butchers [SPK2]: [SPK1]: probably alright should we [SPK2]: It's a noun phra [SPK1]: stick with that then [SPK2]: se at best but yeah [SPK1]: hmm [SPK2]: I think hair meat paper [SPK1]: ok [MOD]: Ok [SPK1]: oh no [SPK2]: [MOD]: now you ha you got the first one and it's hair. obv [SPK2]: yeah [MOD]: viously and then it's the paper [SPK2]: ok [SPK1]: ah [MOD]: and the thirdy [SPK1]: just missed it [MOD]: one [SPK2]: [MOD]: is the meat t [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: but well done you did great [SPK2]: cool [MOD]: excellent. [SPK2]: ok [MOD]: And I think that is the end of the quiz. well thank [SPK2]: woo! [MOD]: you for your [SPK1]: great [MOD]: particip [SPK2]: great [MOD]: ation and [SPK1]: That was fast [MOD]: I hope you enjoyed that. [SPK1]: [MOD]: Do you like more questions? [SPK2]: oh it's done?
